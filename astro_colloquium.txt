20220914%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Level 6 Geoff Opat(+Zoom)%%%Madeline Howell%%%Monash%%%Using Asteroseismology to Measure an Integrated Mass Loss for Evolved Stars in Globular Clusters%%%Mass loss remains a major uncertainty in stellar modelling. In low-mass stars, mass loss is most significant on the red giant branch, and will impact the star's evolutionary path and final stellar remnant. Directly measuring the mass difference of stars in various phases of evolution represents one of the best ways to quantify mass loss. Globular clusters are ideal objects for this, because they contain stars with essentially identical initial masses, metallicities and ages, and hence easily distinguishable evolutionary phases. M4 is currently the only globular cluster for which asteroseismic data exists for stars in multiple phases of evolution. The advent of space-based photometric missions have provided the opportunity to measure stellar masses with unprecedented accuracy using asteroseismology. Using photometry from the K2 mission, we report asteroseismic masses for 75 red giants in M4, the largest seismic sample in a globular cluster to date. From this sample, we measured a precise integrated red giant branch mass loss. Our results for initial mass, horizontal branch mass, Reimers’ coefficient, and integrated red giant branch mass loss show a remarkable agreement with previous studies, but with higher precision through using asteroseismology. We also report preliminary detections of solar-like oscillations in a second globular cluster, M80. Because this cluster is more metal-poor than M4, we can test the potential mass loss-metallicity trend. We emphasise the importance of seismic studies of globular clusters which could potentially allow us to resolve major uncertainties in our understanding of stellar evolution. We discuss the prospects of using photometry from current and future space-based telescopes for this science objective.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%mhowell.jpg%%%-%%%Madeline.Howell1[at]monash.edu%%%-

20220907%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Level 6 Geoff Opat(+Zoom)%%%Dr Aditi Vijayan%%%ANU%%%Understanding X-Ray Signatures of Outflows Through 3-D Simulations%%%Outflows, generated either due to supernova (SN) activity in the disc of a star-forming disc or through the SMBH activity in a larger galaxy, are critical in understanding galaxy evolution. Such outflows are a complex phenomenon which I have studied using HD simulations. In this talk, I will discuss 3-D HD simulations that I ran that study the properties of outflows in a Milky Way-type star-forming galaxy. I will discuss how feedback creates multiphase outflows and how they appear in X-rays. I will share what I found about diffuse X-ray emission from the CGM and its relationship with the underlying gas properties.%%%-%%%-%%%no_image.png%%%-%%%Aditi.Vijayan[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

20220831%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Level 6 Geoff Opat(+Zoom)%%%Dr Giulia Santucci%%%ICRAR/UWA%%%Orbital structures of SAMI passive galaxies from orbit-superposition Schwarzschild models.%%%Galaxy mergers are thought to play an important role in how galaxies evolve over time, however, extragalactic astronomers do not yet completely understand that merger process, its timing and dependence on galaxy mass. The internal kinematic structures of galaxies are driven by their merger histories, therefore, we expect that the internal kinematic structures of galaxies might show different characteristics depending on their merging history. We apply Schwarzschild orbit-superposition models to passive galaxies in the SAMI Galaxy Survey in order to reconstruct their internal kinematic structure and intrinsic properties. We find that these intrinsic properties correlate strongly with stellar mass and that environment plays a secondary role: at fixed stellar mass, galaxies in the densest regions are more radially anisotropic. Central galaxies and galaxies in high local densities rotate more slowly. We also find suggestions of a possible trend of the fractions of orbits with environment for lower-mass galaxies. Our results demonstrate that after stellar mass, environment does play a role in shaping present-day galaxies.%%%-%%%Research Associate%%%gsantucci.jpg%%%-%%%g.santucci[at]unsw.edu.au%%%gsantucci.pptx

20220817%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Laby Theatre(+Zoom)%%%A Prof Yuan-Sen Ting%%%ANU%%%On Modelling Complex Systems in Astronomy%%%Astronomy today is fundamentally different than it was even just a decade ago. Our increasing ability to collect a large amount of data from ever more powerful instrumental has enabled many new opportunities. However, such opportunity also comes with new challenges. The bottleneck stems from the fact that most astronomical observations are inherently high dimension — from “imaging” the Universe at the finest details to fully characterising tens of millions of spectra consisting of tens of thousands of wavelength pixels. In this regime, classical astrostatistics approaches struggle.</p><p>I will present two different machine learning approaches to quantify complex systems in astronomy. (1) Reductionist approach: I will discuss how machine learning can optimally compress information and extract higher-order moment information in stochastic processes. (2) A generative approach: I will discuss how generative models, such as normalising flow, allow us to properly model the vast astronomy data set, enabling the study of complex astronomy systems directly in their raw dimensional space.%%%-%%%DECRA Fellow, Hubble, Carnegie-Princeton and IAS Fellow%%%yting.png%%%-%%%yuan-sen.ting@anu.edu.au%%%yting.txt

20220810%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Anita Petzler%%%CSIRO%%%Hydroxyl as a Probe of the Interstellar Medium%%%The molecular gas of the interstellar medium provides the raw material for star formation, yet its principle component – molecular hydrogen – is essentially invisible at radio wavelengths. Instead we must infer its presence and properties through the study of other tracer molecules, such as hydroxyl (OH). OH, with its four ground-rotational transitions at 1612, 1665, 1667 and 1720 MHz is a challenging molecule to observe due both to the weakness of its lines and the complexity of their excitation. However, the complex excitation of OH holds valuable information about the host molecular gas. The satellite lines at 1612 and 1720 MHz in particular, with their ubiquitous anomalous excitation, are much more sensitive to local conditions than the main lines which rarely diverge from their expected excitation at local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In this talk I will discuss my PhD research which focused on exploring the utility of this interesting molecule. I will also introduce my current project which is to monitor the time-variability of high-gain OH masers in star forming regions.%%%-%%%Research Plus Postdoctoral Fellow%%%apetzler.jpg%%%-%%%Anita.Petzler[at]csiro.au%%%-

20220803%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Laby Theatre(+Zoom)%%%A Prof Deanne B. Fisher%%%Swinburne University%%%How do galaxies regulate their own star formation?%%%Over 2/3 of all star formation in the Universe occurs in gas-rich, super-high pressure clumpy galaxies in the epoch of redshift z~1-3. However, because these galaxies are so distant we are limited in the information available to study the properties of star formation and gas in these systems. I will present results using a sample of extremely rare, nearby galaxies (from the DYNAMO survey and the new DUVET survey) that are very well matched to high-z main-sequence galaxies. We use these galaxies as laboratories to study the processes inside galaxies in the dominate mode of star formation in the Universe. In this talk I will report on results that are aimed at testing models of star formation in galaxies, which are designed to simultaneously explain star formation and kinematics. I will discuss very recent efforts to connect the regulation of gas via outflows to the picture of how galaxies maintain their star formation rates, and outlook for the future with the new Australian led large ESO program, GECKOS.%%%-%%%Future Fellow, Deputy Director for CAS%%%dfisher.png%%%-%%%dfisher[at]swin.edu.au%%%-

Secondly, I will present the first observational method to directly measure massive star cloud collapse timescales and progenitor star lifetimes of gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae. These observational efforts include our Hubble Space Telescope and Keck program data, along with other telescope data, and have important implications for, and can directly benefit from, large-scale cosmological simulations, JWST and 30m-class telescopes, and 21 cm mapping of reionisation by the Square Kilometre Array.%%%-%%%Future Fellow%%%jcooke.jpg%%%-%%%jeffreycooke[at]swin.edu.au%%%jcooke.pdf

20220713%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Laby Theatre(+Zoom)%%%Dr Manisha Caleb%%%The University of Sydney%%%Exploring the fast transient landscape with MeerKAT%%%Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have a story which has been told and retold many times over the past few years as they have sparked excitement and controversy since the pioneering discovery in 2007. The FRB class encompasses a number of microsecond-millisecond duration pulses occurring at Galactic to cosmological distances with energies spanning several orders of magnitude. Many radio telescopes around the world are currently undertaking wide area surveys and targeted searches to discover and localise FRBs, as their true potential can only be realised up host galaxy identification and association. Significant effort is being put into localising FRBs to sub-arcsecond precision by radio interferometers around the globe. The MeerTRAP project at the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa has been operational since 2019 and has discovered ~25 FRBs and localised a handful of them to host galaxies, including an FRB localised to sub-arcsecond precision at z~1. In my talk, I will present the recent discoveries and the multi-wavelength follow-up efforts from the MeerTRAP project.%%%-%%%DECRA Fellow%%%mcaleb.jpg%%%-%%%manisha.caleb[at]sydney.edu.au%%%-

"Bells not Whistles":  Some massive stars undergo shock-driven outbursts before the cores collapse.  I will show that nonlinear acoustics rules out a standard explanation for how these events are driven, a result that deepens the mystery of their origin.</p><p>2. "Do crashes make flashes?": Compact supernovae can be aspherical enough to fling ejecta sideways, causing collisions outside the progenitor.   I address the open question: can a circumstellar collision ever be visible from afar, or will it be smothered by the ejecta surrounding it?</p><p>3. "The LUVS small satellite concept."   This would be an instrument to perform rapid ultraviolet alert follow-up and chase binary neutron star coalescence signals.  It is also a testbed for fast, cheap, off-the-shelf mission development in the New Space paradigm, intended to show that scaling laws, which say space must be hard, can be broken.%%%-%%%-%%%cmatzner.png%%%-%%%matzner[at]astro.utoronto.ca%%%cmatzner.pdf

It will undertake a 15,000-galaxy IFS survey of nearby z<0.1 galaxies. Fundamentally new science will be achieved compared to existing instruments due to Hector's capability to do the largest IFS galaxy survey to date, with the highest spectral resolution, and imaging 2 effective radii on most galaxies. </p><p>The high fill-factor imaging fibre bundles `hexabundles’ of the type used on the SAMI instrument, have been improved and enlarged to cover up to 27-arcsec diameter. Hector has 21 hexabundles over a 2-degree field feeding both the new 'Spector' spectrograph and existing AAOmega spectrograph. The new dual-arm spectrograph has the highest spectral resolution of any large IFS nearby galaxy survey of 1.3 Angstrom. This is the key to enable higher order stellar kinematics to be measured on a larger fraction of galaxies, and to link those galaxies to the large-scale environments in which they form to test formation models of galaxies. </p><p>The Hector survey is aligned to the 4MOST WAVES-North and WAVES-South regions.  The WAVES data will give the environment metrics necessary to relate how local and global environments influence galaxy growth through gas accretion, star formation and spins measured with Hector. The WALLABY ASKAP survey will trace HI gas across the Hector fields, which in combination with Hector will give a complete view of gas accretion and star formation.</p><p>This talk will discuss what makes Hector scientifically unique and the new opportunities it offers Australian astronomers.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow, Director Astralis-Usyd%%%jbryant.png%%%-%%%julia.bryant[at]sydney.edu.au%%%jbryant.pdf

I will present the alignments of galaxies' spin axes with respect to nearby cosmic web filaments as a function of various properties of the galaxies and their constituent bulges and discs. I will exploit the SAMI Galaxy Survey to identify 3D spin axes from spatially-resolved stellar kinematics for galaxies and their kinematic bulge and disc components. The mass of the bulge is found to be the primary parameter of correlation with spin-filament alignments. I will discuss our findings in terms of possible formation pathways for the galaxies, bulges and discs.%%%-%%%ASTRO 3D Postdoctoral Fellow%%%sbarsanti.jpeg%%%-%%%Stefania.Barsanti[at]anu.edu.au%%%sbarsanti.mp4

20220525%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Laby Theatre(+Zoom)%%%Dr Susan Wei%%%UniMelbourne%%%Variational Inference for Bayesian Neural Networks via Resolution of Singularities%%%In contrast to regular models, singular statistical models lack identifiability and a positive definite Fisher information matrix. Singular models are in fact ubiquitous in modern machine learning, with neural networks serving as a prominent example. Coinciding with the resurgence of interest in Bayesian neural networks, this work sets out to characterize the approximation gap in variational inference for the posterior distribution over neural network weights. The result rests on a central insight from singular learning theory according to which the posterior distribution over the parameters of a singular model, following an algebraic-geometrical transformation known as a desingularization map, is asymptotically a mixture of so-called standard forms. We proceed to demonstrate that a generalized gamma mean-field family, following desingularization, can recover the leading order term of the model evidence. The theoretical results are accompanied by a set of experiments in which we employ affine coupling layers to learn the unknown desingularization map.%%%-%%%DECRA Fellow%%%swei.png%%%-%%%susan.wei[at]unimelb.edu.au%%%swei.mp4

JWST will deliver ultra-sensitive observations at previously inaccessible infrared wavelengths. Among the many exciting programs in Webb's first year is the Treasury program UNCOVER which will take ultradeep NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopy boosted by the gravitational lensing cluster Frontier Field Abell 2744. I will look ahead and discuss the science goals of this public program, such as finding First Light galaxies during the Dark Ages at z>10 and studying the ultra-low luminosity galaxies at later times that were responsible for reionization. The program will support a broad array of additional science including stellar mass complete studies to z=10, the role of dust obscuration at high redshift, and the various pathways of quenching star formation.%%%-%%%Senior Research Fellow%%%ilabbe.png%%%-%%%ilabbe[at]swin.edu.au%%%ilabbe.zip

20220406%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Yisheng Qiu%%%Zhejiang University%%%Starduster: A multi-wavelength SED model based on radiative transfer simulations and deep learning%%%In this talk, I will introduce Starduster, a supervised deep learning model that predicts the multi-wavelength SED from galaxy geometry parameters and star formation history by emulating dust radiative transfer simulations. The model is comprised of three specifically designed neural networks, which take into account the features of dust attenuation and emission. We utilise the Skirt radiative transfer simulation to produce data for the training data of neural networks. Each neural network can be trained using ∼4000−5000 samples. Compared with the direct results of the Skirt simulation, our deep learning model produces 0.1−0.2 mag errors in FUV to FIR wavelengths. At some bands, the uncertainty is only 0.01 mag. As an application, we fit our model to the observed SEDs of IC4225 and NGC5166. Our model can reproduce the observations, and successfully predicts that both IC4225 and NGC5166 are edge-on galaxies. However, the predicted geometry parameters are different from image-fitting studies. Our analysis implies that the inconsistency is mainly due to the degeneracy in the star formation history of the stellar disk and bulge. In addition, we find that the predicted fluxes at 20μm−80μm by our SED model are correlated with bulge radius. Our SED code is public available and can be applied to both SED-fitting and SED-modelling of galaxies from semi-analytic models.%%%-%%%-%%%yqiu.png%%%-%%%yishengq[at]126.com%%%yqiu.mp4

One of the most precise probes of this is weak gravitational lensing. This can be combined with galaxy clustering and examined on nonlinear scales to obtain very precise measurements of cosmological parameters. I present constraints from galaxy clustering and weak lensing on ~Megaparsec scales using the galaxy catalogue from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. I show that these data lead to a statistically significant tension in the amplitude of matter fluctuations at low redshift compared to that measured by the Planck cosmic microwave background satellite.%%%-%%%-%%%bwibking.jpg%%%-%%%ben.wibking[at]anu.edu.au%%%bwibking.pdf

That number is expected to increase significantly over the coming years as these experiments become even more sensitive. The increased number of detections, and the improved sensitivity of these instruments, allows us to probe the ultra-strong regime of gravity, as well as the formation history of these systems. I will discuss ongoing efforts to test general relativity in the ultra strong-field regime, including tests of the no-hair theorem and searches for gravitational-wave memory -- a permanent deformation of spacetime following the passage of a gravitational wave. I will also discuss efforts to detect orbital eccentricity in these systems, which has led to potentially the first observation of a second-generation black hole merger.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow%%%plasky.jpg%%%-%%%Paul.Lasky[at]monash.edu%%%plasky_2022.pdf

Thus the environmental dependence of dark matter halo properties prompts a correlation between galaxy properties and the environment. In this talk, I will discuss the results from our recent works (arXiv:2102.04177 and arXiv:2201.10480) that explored how luminosities in various passbands and the associated galaxy properties are correlated with the environment.

In this talk, I will present our latest results from ~4,000,000 galaxies at z~2-7 identified in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. This large sample has allowed us to reveal 1) rest-frame UV luminosity functions in a very wide luminosity range, 2) the number density excess of bright galaxies beyond the classical Schechter function, and 3) the almost constant star formation efficiency at z~2-7, suggesting that the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density is primarily driven by the structure formation and the cosmic expansion. Extrapolation of this result to higher redshifts suggests a sharp decline of the star formation rate density at z>10, which is consistent with our recent finding of z~13 galaxy candidates and will be directly tested with JWST. Finally, I will briefly introduce our planned JWST Cycle 1 observations.%%%-%%%-%%%yharikane.jpg%%%-%%%hari[at]icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp%%%yharikane.pdf

The variation of Doppler shifts caused by the planet’s orbital motion enables absorption lines in the exoplanet spectrum to be distinguished from telluric lines. By combining thousands of unique absorption (or emission) lines, the atomic/molecular signatures can be identified unambiguously and detected at high significance. As it is sensitive to the position of the lines, it also allows us to measure the planetary rotation and wind velocity, as well as search for atmospheric variability and inhomogeneity during the transit. In this talk, I will give a review on how we characterise the atmosphere of exoplanets using high-resolution spectroscopy including some of the latest discoveries in the atmosphere of ultra-hot Jupiters.%%%-%%%-%%%snugroho.jpg%%%-%%%stevanus.nugroho[at]nao.ac.jp%%%snugroho.pdf

20220202%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Anitha Ravishankar%%%University of Calgary%%%Kinematics of coronal mass ejections and Auroral Science%%%An accurate understanding of the propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial in the prediction of space weather. CMEs generate geomagnetic storms causing catastrophic damages to power grids on Earth and are serious radiation threat to satellites on low-Earth orbit and their crew during spacewalks. Basic parameters such as their velocity and acceleration varying with time and heliospheric distance away from the Sun gives researchers the opportunity to predict their arrival time in the vicinity of the Earth. Once these clouds of charged particles reach the Earth, aurorae or Northern/Southern lights are generated at higher latitudes. Extreme geomagnetic storms (kp>4) are a matter of concern and also contribute to a beautiful sight with intense auroras.

20211124%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Prof Will Percival%%%University of Waterloo%%%Matching Bayesian and frequentist coverage probabilities when using an approximate data covariance matrix (arXiv:2108.10402)%%%Observational astrophysics consists of making inferences about the Universe by comparing data and models. The credible intervals placed on model parameters are often as important as the maximum a posteriori probability values, as the intervals indicate concordance or discordance between models and with measurements from other data. Intermediate statistics (e.g. the power spectrum) are usually measured and inferences made by fitting models to these rather than the raw data, assuming that the likelihood for these statistics has multivariate Gaussian form. The covariance matrix used to calculate the likelihood is often estimated from simulations, such that it is itself a random variable. This is a standard problem in Bayesian statistics, which requires a prior to be placed on the true model parameters and covariance matrix, influencing the joint posterior distribution. I will review this problem and suggest a new approach linking frequentist and Bayesian approaches that have previously appeared in the astronomical literature.%%%-%%%Director of Waterloo Centre for Astrophysics%%%wpercival.png%%%-%%%will.percival[at]uwaterloo.ca%%%wpercival.mp4

They regularly produce super-Eddington mass fallback rates, and their light curves encode information about the accretion processes and the masses of the star and black hole. I developed a widely used tool for measuring black hole masses with TDE light curves, however, degeneracies between the accretion efficiency and the mass of the disrupted star make it difficult to measure these parameters from the light curve alone. I will show how we can combine information from the TDE light curve with constraints from the spectra and host galaxy to learn about the properties of stars in galactic nuclei.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%bmockler.png%%%-%%%bmockler[at]ucsc.edu%%%bmockler.mp4

The spatially resolved rotation velocity (V) and velocity dispersion (σ) of bulge and disk components have been simultaneously estimated using the penalised pixel fitting (PPXF) method with photometrically defined weights for the two components. The two components show mass-rotation and mass-dispersion relations with similar slopes, but different intercepts suggesting that the galaxy stellar mass scales with both V and σ for both bulge and disk components of all galaxy types. Our findings suggest that the relative contributions of the two components explain, at least to first order, the complex kinematic behaviour of galaxies. Looking further ahead, we compare gas and stellar kinematics in various galaxy types (e.g. star-forming galaxies, AGNs), finding that the difference between stellar and gas velocity dispersions correlates with the contribution of AGN to the ionised gas emission. We also discuss gas and stellar velocity dispersions as proxies for the dynamical masses.%%%-%%%ASTRO3D Postdoctoral Fellow%%%soh.jpg%%%-%%%sree.oh[at]anu.edu.au%%%soh.mp4

They are the most luminous objects in the radio sky; they accelerate particles to the highest energies known; and - by transferring some fraction of their enormous kinetic energy to the surrounding gas (so-called “AGN feedback”) - they regulate the evolution of the most massive galaxies over at least the last seven billion years.\nSensitive, high-resolution radio continuum observations with Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinders are uncovering details of the complex interaction between kpc-scale AGN jets and their environments. I will present theoretical work on modelling the dynamics and synchrotron emission of these interactions, using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques. In this approach, the jet dynamics is described by 3D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, while synchrotron emissivity is calculated in post-processing using an analytical model which fully accounts for the relevant loss processes. I will present some examples of insights into mechanisms responsible for jet production and AGN feedback, gained through combining such models with multi-wavelength observations.%%%-%%%-%%%sshabala.jpg%%%-%%%stanislav.shabala[at]utas.edu.au%%%sshabala.mp4

Pulsars can act as an excellent probe of the Milky Way magnetic field. The average strength of the Galactic magnetic field component parallel to the line of sight can be estimated as 1.232 RM / DM, where RM and DM are the observed rotation and dispersion measure of the pulsar. However, this assumes that the thermal electron density and magnetic field of the interstellar medium are uncorrelated. Using numerical simulations and observations, we test the validity of this assumption. Based on magnetohydrodynamical simulations of driven turbulence, we show that the correlation between the thermal electron density and the small-scale magnetic field increases with increasing Mach number of the turbulence. We find that the assumption of uncorrelated thermal electron density and magnetic fields is valid only for subsonic and transsonic flows, but for supersonic turbulence, the field strength can be severely overestimated by using 1.232 RM / DM.  We then correlate existing pulsar observations from the Australia Telescope National Facility with regions of enhanced thermal electron density and magnetic fields probed by CO data of molecular clouds, magnetic fields from the Zeeman splitting of the 21 cm line, neutral hydrogen column density, and Halpha observations. Using these observational data, we show that the thermal electron density and magnetic fields are largely uncorrelated over kpc scales. Thus, we conclude that the relation 1.232 RM / DM provides a good estimate of the magnetic field on Galactic scales, but might break down on sub-kpc scales.%%%-%%%Postdoc%%%aseta.jpg%%%-%%%amit.seta[at]anu.edu.au%%%aseta.mp4

While most of the stars in the center and disk of a galaxy formed in situ, many of the stars in the stellar halo originated in the many small galaxies that the central host galaxy accreted over billions of years. Currently, though, we lack ways to identify which halo stars originated in which dwarf galaxies or even reliably identify which stars were accreted. By utilizing the Caterpillar simulation suite, a suite of 32 Milky Way-mass galaxies forming, we find that stars with strong enrichment of r-process elements may have preferentially formed in the smallest dwarf galaxies that merged into the Milky Way. We also quantify how well astronomers can kinematically identify stars that accreted together from these tiny dwarf galaxies. Looking forward, we will expand on this work with several more detailed simulations of dwarf galaxy formation and of r-process material mixing into interstellar gas.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%kbrauer.png%%%-%%%kbrauer[at]mit.edu%%%kbrauer.mp4

Peculiar velocities describe the velocity of a galaxy relative to the background expansion of the Universe, imposed by the gravitational influence of the local environment.  In this talk I will present new tests using cosmological simulations to show how combining information from the local peculiar velocity field and galaxy density field provide the tightest constraints on the growth rate.

The wide variety of different survey strategies available play a pivotal role in how we can probe the physics behind these new and exotic transients.

Before their exciting deaths, massive stars produce feedback through a number of mechanisms that are frequently used in subgrid physics models in galaxy simulations to create realistic galaxies. Observations are a key to anchoring these simulations in reality, but there has been limited work on this front, especially for the youngest, embedded HII regions. I explore the effects of direct radiation pressure, dust-processed radiation pressure, photoionization heating and shock-heating from stellar winds in a sample of young HII regions (sources with radii < 0.5 pc) and determine which is the most important for very young stars. This analysis suggests radiative feedback on dust drives the earliest stages of HII region expansion. Additionally, I study the effects of radiative feedback in an exciting population of extremely low-metallicity star-forming galaxies that have been discovered in the local universe which are analogues to Reionization Era galaxies. During the Epoch of Reionization radiative feedback played a significant role in shaping the universe, and such analogues give us a detailed laboratory to explore the effects from feedback. I present deep FUV and optical spectra of two of these extreme emission line galaxies that have strong very-high-ionization optical and FUV emission lines (e.g., CIV, HeII, [FeV], [ArIV]).  I demonstrate that canonical photoionization models, using typical stellar population models, catastrophically fail to reproduce the high-ionization emission lines. I constrain the stellar population properties using the FUV spectral features and explore the deficiencies of current stellar models. By simultaneously fitting the stellar and nebular emission within these extremely high-ionization emission line galaxies, I provide new observational benchmarks of radiative feedback for the next generation of stellar models at very low metallicity. By studying the effects of stellar feedback from single stars in the Milky Way to entire stellar populations in analogues to the first galaxies we can begin to build a coherent picture of stellar feedback as it impacts the vast scales of the universe.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%golivier.png%%%-%%%olivier.15[at]buckeyemail.osu.edu%%%golivier.pdf

Thus, the Lyα line strength of high-z galaxies is considered a promising probe of reionization history. In order to quantitatively understand which properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) determine the transmission of Lya photons, we calculate the transmissivity from the simulated IGM of the Cosmic Dawn II (CoDa II) simulation and analyze the results. We find that the gravitational infall motion around the galaxy, size of the HII region, and self-shielded neutral gas systems are crucial factors.

This strategy is motivated by the traditional assumption that reionization ends at z >~ 6. However, recent constraints from Lyman-α and CMB data prefer a significantly delayed reionization scenario in which reionization is 50% complete at redshifts as low as z ~ 7. In these models, reionization ends at z ~ 5, with large 100 Mpc "islands" of cold, neutral hydrogen persisting in the IGM well below z = 6. We have studied the effect of these neutral hydrogen islands on the 21-cm power spectrum by analysing outputs of a state-of-the-art radiative transfer simulation of the IGM calibrated to the CMB and Lyman-α forest data. We calculate the power spectra of the 21-cm signal from this simulations and compare them with a more traditional reionization model in which reionization is completed by z = 6. Contrary to previous models, we find that thanks to the late end of reionization the 21-cm power continues at be high (~ 1 mK^2) at k ~ 0.1 h/cMpc at z = 5-6. At z = 5.5, for example, the power spectrum can be two or more orders of magnitude higher than the traditional models. This enhanced 21-cm power spectrum signal should be easily detectable by HERA and SKA1-LOW for reasonable integration times, assuming optimistic foreground subtraction. We argue that the redshift range z = 5-6 is very attractive for 21-cm experiments due to easier thermal noise characteristics and synergies with abundant multi-wavelength observations. %%%-%%%Postdoc%%%jraste.png%%%-%%%janakee[at]theory.tifr.res.in%%%jraste.mp4

The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a unique new way to probe the ionized baryons in the IGM. Cosmological models with different parameters lead to different DM-redshift (DM−z) relations. Additionally, the over/under-dense regions in the IGM and intervening galaxies' circumgalactic medium lead to scattering around the mean DM−z relations. I will present the recent work I have done using the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations to study the DM-z relation, and the scatter around it. I find that almost all of the FRBs found at low-redshifts have significantly larger observed DMs than predicted from simulations. I will also show that we would need of the order 9000 localised FRBs to constrain AGN feedback efficiency. Finally I will talk about a future project measuring the metallicity of the IGM in EAGLE and the sizes of ‘metal bubbles’ around galaxies at the end of the epoch of reionisation. %%%-%%%PhD Student%%%abatten.jpg%%%-%%%abatten[at]swin.edu.au%%%abatten.mp4

Taking the temperature and studying the implications%%%ALMA observations have revealed the presence of dust in the first generations of galaxies in the Universe. However, the dust temperature Td remains mostly unconstrained due to the few available FIR continuum data. This introduces large uncertainties in the derived dust masses, infrared luminosities, and obscured fraction of star formation of high-z (z>5) galaxies. We have developed a new analytical method that allows us to constrain Td using a single continuum data point at 158 microns by combining it with the overlying CII emission. With our method, one can analyse uniquely CII and continuum detections, and the targets of ALMA large programs such as ALPINE and REBELS. In particular, REBELS is providing us with unprecedented numerous continuum detections at z>7, increasing of a factor ~6 the available data so far. Our analysis of these sources will shed light on the evolution of the dust temperature and dependent quantities with redshift, glimpsing the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) for the first time. Preliminary results indicate that the dust temperature increases at a higher redshift, with a larger scatter w.r.t. to that observed in the local universe. We physically motivate the increasing Td-redshift trend as a consequence of the decreasing total gas depletion time induced by a more vigorous cosmological accretion at early times. A higher Td has testable implications: (a) it reduces the tension between local and high-z IRX-β relation, (b) it alleviates the problem of the uncomfortably large dust masses deduced from observations of some EoR galaxies, (c) it results in a larger obscured fraction of the SFR. This is consistent with the flattening of the cosmic Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) at z>4 suggested by recent observations at FIR and radio wavelengths of dusty UV-obscured systems.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%lsommovigo.jpeg%%%-%%%laura.sommovigo[at]sns.it%%%lsommovigo.mp4

For the last two years these prototypes have been regularly collecting data to verify their performance against the SKA-Low specifications and simulations, including making all-sky images every two seconds used for transient searches. The transient identification algorithm used 2-second difference images to find candidates and required their detection in the images from both stations. In approximately 360 hours of data using a single coarse channel (0.926 MHz bandwidth), we identified a few episodes of extremely bright pulses from the pulsar PSR B0950+08 and several transients from an unknown object, which is currently under investigation. We also determined preliminary upper limits on surface density of radio transients at a 2-second timescale. We plan to increase the bandwidth by at least 40 times (to about 40 MHz) and time resolution to 10 ms or better in order to improve the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude and start detecting hundreds of FRBs per year. This upgrade will transform the stations into low-frequency FRB survey machines looking for FRBs and signals from extraterrestrial intelligence in high-time resolution all-sky images, which will pave the way to similar searches with hundreds of SKA-Low stations.%%%-%%%Associate Professor%%%rwayth.png%%%-%%%R.Wayth[at]curtin.edu.au%%%rwayth.mp4

Using astro-chronological and geo-chronological techniques, we show that these traditions have a terminus ante quem of approximately 12,000 years.%%%-%%%Associate Professor In Cultural Astronomy%%%dhamacher.jpg%%%-%%%duane.hamacher[at]unimelb.edu.au%%%dhamacher.mp4

These massive quiescent galaxies (MQG) have proven difficult to reproduce in sufficient numbers in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. While the latest generation of simulations have begun to achieve more consistent number densities through detailed prescriptions of AGN feedback, the observed quenched galaxies still appear to quench at earlier epochs. This begs the question: how early in the Universe can we still find quiescent galaxies? Additionally, high redshift MQGs host old stellar populations that can provide insights into the star-formation conditions during the epoch of reionisation. The intense star-bursts that likely formed MQGs are expected to have a different distribution of stellar masses, the initial-mass function (IMF), compared to local elliptical galaxies. I present work done to identify these rare MQGs at high redshift based on the FENIKS survey and determine some of their physical properties using a combination of deep HST imaging and MOSFIRE spectra.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%jesdaile.png%%%-%%%jesdaile[at]swin.edu.au%%%jesdaile.key

New low-frequency radio telescopes able to probe the neutral hydrogen in the high-redshift Universe (z~6-30) come in two flavours: single-antennas that probe the average thermal history of the Universe (such as EDGES, SARAS and REACH), and interferometers that measure the spatial fluctuations of 21cm emission (such as HERA, MWA and SKA). </p><p> Both come with an extraordinary challenge: bright foregrounds amplify small spectral "features" in the instrument, obscuring the background signal unless calibrated to one part in 10^5. Accounting for these effects is susceptible to inadvertant removal of part of the signal, which has led to several retractions of published upper-limits over the past decade. Add to this the extremely surprising results from EDGES in 2018, and we must ask: how much can we trust the results of 21cm experiments, and how can we build confidence amongst the community? </p><p> In this talk, I will discuss my role in answering these questions with two current 21cm experiments -- EDGES and HERA. </p><p> EDGES is working to verify its result from 2018 using new and improved data and improved analysis techniques. I will describe our new effort to forward-model systematics, starting with receiver calibration and simple models for the antenna reflection coefficients, showing the effects of propagating their full correlated uncertainties on the cosmological estimates. </p><p> Concerning HERA, I will report on the work of the Validation team (Aguirre et al., 2021), in support of our recent first upper limit (Kern et al., 2021). We produced a sophisticated end-to-end simulation of the full observation, including thermal noise, realistic foregrounds and many instrumental systematics. This simulation was processed with the exact analysis pipeline used for the data. I will discuss our philosophy and findings, with special regards for future improvements.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Researcher%%%smurray.jpg%%%-%%%steven.g.murray[at]asu.edu%%%smurray.mp4

Nielsen%%%Swinburne University%%%The Circumgalactic Medium at Cosmic Noon with KCWI%%%The star formation history of the universe reveals that galaxies most actively build their stellar mass at "cosmic noon" (z=1-3). The gas accreting onto galaxies to drive their construction and the resulting metal-enriched material ejected from these galaxies due to feedback must pass through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The CGM is a massive reservoir of diffuse, multiphase gas out to ~200 kpc and is the interface between the intergalactic medium and the galaxy. While the CGM is well-studied at z<1, little attention has been paid to the reservoir when star formation is most active, due to the difficulty in identifying host galaxies at cosmic noon. The installation of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI), a sensitive integral field spectrograph, on Keck II has opened a new window to quickly identify galaxies via their Lyman alpha emission at cosmic noon as well as to directly image the CGM in emission. I will introduce two new surveys with KCWI aiming to study the CGM in (1) absorption around galaxies at z=2-3 and (2) emission around local starbursting galaxies (cosmic noon analogues). These surveys are still in progress, but first results reveal strong outflows at cosmic noon and tantalising sub-kiloparsec structure in the CGM.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Research Associate%%%nnielsen.jpg%%%cgm.jpg%%%nikolenielsen[at]swin.edu.au%%%nnielsen.mp4

Despite their frequency and high energy output, what causes these bursts have eluded astronomers since their discovery over a decade ago. FRBs may result from magnetar bursts, binary neutron star mergers (producing kilonovae), neutron stars collapsing to black holes (blitzars) or several other theories.  Information on emission coherent with the radio burst in other wavelengths can help reveal the physical processes that create these bursts.  I present results from an observational program that can do this called the Deeper Faster Wider (DWF) program. A key part of the DWF program is coordinating ~10 multi-wavelength observatories to perform deep, wide-field, fast cadence observations on the same field simultaneously to collect possible imaging on fast-evolving transients before they fade. Importantly, DWF can collect data before, during and after fast transients. Typically, a DWF observing run goes for a week.  In particular, I present results from DWF operation run 8 (DWF-O8). During DWF-O8, two FRBs were detected with the Murriyang Radio Telescope (formerly known as the Parkes Radio Telescope). Simultaneously observing with Murriayng was the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory , Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope, AstroSat, the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the Huntsman Telescope, Murriyang and the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope, amongst others. %%%-%%%Postdoctoral Researcher%%%jzhang.png%%%-%%%jielaizhang[at]swin.edu.au%%%jzhang.mp4

Most studies use injection-recovery simulations to determine completeness functions. Although conceptually the same, these simulations have subtle but important differences in their definition of the completeness function across existing studies. In turn, this requires implementation of different methods to obtain the final determination of the UVLFs. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of existing methods using a reference set of mock observations, and then compare the methods when applied to the same set of Hubble Legacy Field (HLF) images. We find that some methods may suffer limitations in a presence of substantial photometric scatter and/or steep luminosity functions.%%%-%%%-%%%nleethochawalit.png%%%-%%%nicha.leethochawalit@unimelb.edu.au%%%-

20210317%%%12:00 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 2, Hercus Theatre (+Zoom)%%%Prof. David Jamieson%%%University of Melbourne%%%Galileo's astronomical observations: when pushing back the frontiers was risky business%%%Galileo's prolific letters to friends, colleagues, patrons and other associates are valuable treatises in their own right.  A letter he wrote on 21 December 1613 to a former student in Prague sets out his forthright views on the relationship between religious doctrine and science.  Galileo's letter found its way into the hands of the Inquisition in Rome and this ultimately led to Galileo's conviction of "vehement suspicion of heresy".  Galileo must have realised his letter would cause trouble because he claimed the letter passed to the authorities in Rome had been altered by malevolent forces out to damage him and strengthen their case for heresy.  He released a new version of the letter with much less inflammatory language which he claimed was the original.  In a sensational discovery in the library of the Royal Society in London UK, Galileo's claim of alteration is shown to be false.  Incorrectly filed for 250 years, the original of the inflammatory letter was accidentally rediscovered in 2018, with edits in Galileo's own handwriting to tone down the language.  This is a remarkable piece of history about a physicist facing dire consequences at the hands of the authorities.  A particular passage in the letter has captured my attention.  Galileo wrote "This (scientific knowledge) applies especially to those sciences about which one can read only very small phrases and scattered conclusions in the Scripture as is particularly the case for astronomy, of which it contains such a small portion that one does not even find in it the names of all the planets."  I will link this statement back to Galileo's observations of the planet Neptune that occurred in December 1612 to January 1613 just on one year before he wrote his inflammatory letter.  We may be able to glean new insights into his thinking at the time.%%%-%%%-%%%djamieson.png%%%-%%%d.jamieson@unimelb.edu.au%%%-

Explaining why this is the case is a key challenge of galaxy evolution theories, but a comprehensive theory of what causes galaxies to quench their star formation is still missing. I will discuss a toy model of quenching which successfully reproduces a number of important differences between quiescent and star-forming galaxies at redshift 0, including their different mass-metallicity relations and mass-size planes. This model was born out of my studies of stellar metallicities in the SAMI galaxy survey, and I will also give a brief summary of my metallicity measurements and some of the powerful statistical tools I've used in my analysis. %%%-%%%-%%%svaughan.png%%%-%%%sam.vaughan@sydney.edu.au%%%svaughan.pdf

Examples of the former include the discovery of T and Y-class brown dwarfs from surveys like 2MASS or WISE, or higher and higher redshift QSOs from larger and larger surveys. </p><p> Opening new phase space through higher measurement precision has been particularly prominent lately - exoplanets being first discovered by increasing precise Doppler measurements, more exoplanets being discovered by increasing precise photometry from space, or gravitation waves being confirmed by increasingly precise strain meters. </p><p> The Veloce instrument on the AAT seeks to push the boundaries of increasingly precise Doppler velocity measurement at a fraction of the cost of competing instruments.

We generally interpret this mass dependence as a signature of stellar feedback despite the fact that stellar feedback models also predict time evolution in the star formation efficiency. In this talk, I'll focus on this apparent tension, and show that to remain in agreement with observations, competing feedback scenarios require qualitatively different assumptions about the properties of dust and the duty cycle of star formation in galaxies. As a result, I'll discuss the prospects for distinguishing models based on the 'dustiness' and 'burstiness' of galaxies found in upcoming galaxy surveys with JWST and ALMA, and potentially via constraints on reionization from future 21-cm experiments.%%%-%%%-%%%jmirocha.png%%%-%%%jordan.mirocha@mcgill.ca%%%-

While the use of fitting formulae to stellar tracks remains a popular choice for modelling stellar evolution in population synthesis codes, they are not adaptable to changes in the stellar tracks. In this talk, I will present results from an alternative approach, METISSE, which uses interpolation between sets of pre-computed stellar tracks to approximate evolution parameters for a population of stars. It can readily make use of stellar models computed with different stellar evolution codes and can compare their predictions for populations of stars. Using METISSE with the data from two different stellar evolution codes, I will show how different physical ingredients used in the evolution of massive stars, such as the treatment of their radiation dominated envelopes, can lead to differences in their evolutionary properties. These differences are important as they can help us account for observations of the stellar populations and the formation of gravitational wave progenitors.%%%-%%%-%%%pagrawal.png%%%-%%%pagrawal@swin.edu.au%%%pagrawal.pdf

Whereas these models are practically indistinguishable with respect to the predicted characteristics of high-mass substructure, the critical difference lies in the abundance and statistical properties of low-mass galactic substructure. Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing provides a unique opportunity to search for gravitational signatures of such low-mass substructure in lens galaxies beyond the Local Group. In this talk, I will present a novel approach to observationally constrain the statistical nature of low-mass sub-galactic structure in the inner regions of massive elliptical lens galaxies, based on the power spectrum of surface-brightness anomalies measured in highly-magnified galaxy-scale Einstein rings and gravitational arcs. A future comparison of these results with the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations might either verify the CDM paradigm or require its substantial revision.%%%-%%%-%%%dbayer.png%%%-%%%dbayer@swin.edu.au%%%dbayer.pdf

What cosmological simulations can (and cannot) tell us about the cold phase of the CGM%%%Simulations are now allowing us to probe the scales of the CGM (circumgalactic medium) around galaxies in order to look at the influence of realistic galaxy formation processes. However, it is apparent that the properties of the multi-phase CGM are not yet converged in simulations (e.g. Van de Voort et al., 2019; Hummels et al., 2019), hence their reliability to make predictions is still in question. It is also clear the CGM plays a key role in the evolution of a galaxy; it is a supply of gas for star formation and a key site for feedback-generated outflows, along with the recycling of baryons (for a recent review see Tumlinson et al., 2017). </p><p> During this talk I will discuss the results of my recent paper (Garratt-Smithson et al. 2020 - available on astro-ph) and in particular the significant mass of HI seen in the CGM of EAGLE galaxies between redshift 2 and 0. I will explore the physical conditions of this HI, and discuss whether or not we can constrain the fraction existing in the cold neutral medium. I will also discuss the physical processes we can constrain by studying the detailed properties of this CGM HI gas; in particular I link my results back to AGN and stellar feedback, along with how this is modelled in simulations.

One critical measurement required is the ionizing (or Lyman continuum, LyC) escape fraction from observed galaxy samples. A major difficulty arises from the level of transmission of LyC through the intergalactic medium (IGM), an unknown (but essential) quantity in the calculation of LyC escape from individual sources. The typical method is to assume an average transmission value based on consideration of HI column density distribution functions, but is this appropriate? In general, observational surveys at high redshift are strongly biased towards the brightest objects as these are the easiest to detect. Given the fact that LyC emission is remarkably faint, we should expect to only detect those galaxies with the highest emergent LyC flux. This, in turn, suggests that detections of LyC in surveys will be biased towards IGM sightlines with higher than average transmission of ionizing photons. In this talk I discuss the quantification of this IGM transmission bias for LyC detections and explore the implications when considering the recovered LyC escape values from current surveys. Careful consideration of such biases will be critical in understanding how LyC escape depends on galaxy properties, which ultimately colours our understanding of how reionization proceeds.%%%-%%%-%%%rbassett.png%%%-%%%rbassett@swin.edu.au%%%rbassett.pdf

At the end of their lives, some explode as supernovae, producing heavy elements that are distributed into the surrounding interstellar gas. New stars that are created from this gas contain the elements that were produced from the previous generations of stars. From the spatial distribution of elements, it is therefore possible to constrain the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the galaxies. This approach, Galactic Archaeology, has been popularly used for our Milky Way Galaxy. It can also be applied to external galaxies thanks to the recent and future observations with integral field units (extra-galactic archaeology). My team has been running hydrodynamical simulations from cosmological initial conditions including detailed chemical enrichment. By comparing with observations, I will discuss the roles of metal flows, i.e., gas infall, outflow, radial flow, and stellar migration, in the evolution of Milky Way Galaxy and galaxies in general.%%%-%%%-%%%ckobayashi.png%%%-%%%c.kobayashi@herts.ac.uk%%%-

Determining the UV luminosity function to faint magnitudes, coupled with more accurate determinations of the escape fraction (from observations of the Balmer lines and UV continuum), will address the ionizing photon budget from galaxies. The census of the fraction of high redshift star-forming galaxies with Lyman alpha in emission will constrain the neutral fraction of the IGM at z>6, and the size of the ionized bubbles, and the study of rest-UV absorption lines and nebular emission will shed light on the outflows and the role of the circum-galactic medium.

We compare the observed population of BeXBs in the Small Magellanic Cloud to simulated populations of BeXB-like systems produced with the COMPAS population synthesis code. We focus on the apparently higher minimal mass of Be stars in BeXBs than in the Be population at large. Assuming that BeXBs experienced only dynamical stable mass transfer, their mass distribution suggests that the efficiency of accretion rarely drops below ~30%. We also investigate the observed orbital period distribution and number of observed systems, looking for further constraints on our mass transfer models. Finally, we argue if ultra stripped stars could lead to fast rotating neutron stars in BeXBs. We expect our findings to affect our previous predictions on the population of double compact mergers.%%%-%%%-%%%svinciguerra.png%%%-%%%serena.vinciguerra[at]aei.mpg.de%%%-

As upcoming `stage IV' cosmology redshift surveys will map out the distribution of galaxies with a higher precision, and in a much larger survey volume than previous projects, it is important to review how the power spectrum is modelled and estimated. After going through a very brief review of large scale structure cosmology and two point statistics, I will give an overview of my work on how to accurately model the power spectrum when such large volumes are considered. I will give a particular focus to unequal time correlators, and what the effect of using "effective redshift" approximations can have on the power spectrum amplitude. 2) In the second part of my talk I will give an overview of the upcoming 4MOST cosmology redshift survey, due to launch in 2022. I will then discuss the ongoing development of the power spectrum estimation pipeline that will be used to test the mock catalogues for the survey, and how these can help for forecasting and survey design.%%%-%%%-%%%dpryer.png%%%-%%%d.pryer[at]sussex.ac.uk%%%-

Integral Field Spectroscopy has revolutionised our capability of measuring resolved stellar kinematic data and has changed our classic view of early-type and late-type galaxies as two distinctly seperate populations. In this talk I will highlight several key results from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, which provides two-dimensional stellar population, gas and stellar kinematic measurements for ~3000 galaxies. I will show how specific angular momentum and lambdaR (spin parameter proxy) gradually change as a function of morphology and environment, and compare these to predictions from cosmological simulations. Furthermore, I will present recent results that link the intrinsic shape of galaxies and their stellar populations to their rotational properties.%%%-%%%-%%%jvds.png%%%-%%%jesse.vandesande[at]sydney.edu.au%%%jvsd.pdf

Ideally such a model would incorporate star formation, stellar feedback, gravitational instability, the maintenance of turbulence, and transport of gas through the ISM into a unified framework, simultaneously explaining the relation between gas content and star formation (the Kennicutt relation), the observed correlation between galaxies' star formation rates and velocity dispersions, and a variety of other observations. I summarise the various ways that theorists have attempted to fit together physical ingredients to reach this goal, the differing physical pictures behind these models, and the strengths and weaknesses of each when it comes to reproducing the observations. I then show that it is possible to combine the best elements of these models into a single, unified picture that successfully reproduces most of the major observations. I suggest future observations and numerical experiments that can be used to test this unified model.%%%-%%%-%%%mkrumholz.png%%%-%%%mark.krumholz[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

These star-forming galaxies are particularly interesting since they are Milky Way progenitors at this epoch. I will discuss how the kinematic properties of these galaxies around the peak of the cosmic star formation rate density differ from massive galaxies which have been analysed so far. I will also show results from our recent ALMA observations of two strongly lensed z~1 main-sequence galaxies and from a nearby galaxy sample, called DYNAMO, showing similar physical properties to high-redshift main-sequence galaxies. These observations allow us to compare the molecular and ionised gas kinematics at high spatial resolution for the first time (few hundred parsec in our z~1 galaxies).

20191009%%%14:15 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Mike Wilensky%%%University of Washington%%%Characterizing and Mitigating Radio Frequency Interference in Reionization Cosmology%%%Through radio interferometry, we use redshifted 21cm radiation from neutral Hydrogen as a probe into the universe's ionization history. The relevant wavelengths for observation are concurrent with those allocated for common radio broadcasts such as FM radio and digital television. Consequently, these transmissions can interfere with radio observations, and are thus dubbed radio frequency interference (RFI). The ever-looming threat of radio frequency interference demands that radio telescopes be placed in extremely remote locations. Even still, extremely remote telescopes such as the Murchison Widefield Array observe interference at non-negligible levels. In this talk, we introduce a new RFI mitigation strategy, known as Sky-Subtracted Incoherent Noise Spectra (SSINS), which was designed to detect extremely faint RFI. We show that the increased RFI mitigation afforded by SSINS makes a noticeable difference in redshifted 21cm power spectrum estimations. Furthermore, through analytic calculations and simulations, we characterize the expected effect of RFI on 21cm power spectra. Ultimately we conclude that RFI poses a serious threat to reionization science, and that pristine site conditions will be essential to making a detection of Hydrogen reionization.%%%-%%%-%%%no_image.png%%%-%%%mjw768[at]uw.edu%%%-

These objects are nearing the main sequence and so have cleared their inner discs and stopped accreting, but are still contracting and have an evolving internal structure. Examining the large-scale surface brightness and magnetic field maps for a small sample of weak-line T Tauri stars, we find that stars with similar brightness maps can have different magnetic field topologies. The magnetic map results more generally suggest some differences in the large-scale dynamo fields of weak-line T Tauri stars compared with classical T Tauri stars and main sequence stars of a corresponding spectral type. </p><p> In addition to studying weak-line T Tauri star magnetic activity, Doppler Imaging allows us to hunt for orbiting close-in giant planets. Early results indicate that the occurrence rate of close-in giant planets is higher among weak-line T Tauri stars than in the main sequence population. </p><p>  Additionally, I will touch on the work being done at USQ's MINERVA Australis facility following up and measuring masses for planetary system discovered by NASA's TESS mission. %%%-%%%-%%%bnicholson.png%%%-%%%belinda.nicholson[at]usq.edu.au%%%-

Understanding the nature of the ionizing sources, the associated ionization of the IGM, and its impact on subsequent structure formation and galaxy evolution by means of radiative feedback effects, represent key outstanding questions in current astrophysics. </p><p> In the past few years high-redshift galaxy observations and simulations have significantly extended our knowledge on the nature of high-redshift galaxies. However, essential properties such as the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies into the intergalactic medium and their dependency on galactic properties remain essentially unknown, but determine significantly the distribution and time evolution of the ionized regions during reionization. Analysing this ionization topology by means of the neutral hydrogen sensitive 21cm signal with radio interferometers such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) offers a complementary and unique opportunity to determine the nature of these first galaxies and pin down the reionization history. </p><p> In this talk, I will discuss how synergising high-redshift galaxy observations with 21cm signal detections can provide constraints on reionization. Furthermore, I will show results from a self-consistent semi-numerical model of galaxy evolution and reionization, and discuss the potential of inferring galactic properties, as the escape fraction of ionizing photons, with the 21cm signal by means of its bispectrum.%%%-%%%-%%%ahutter.png%%%-%%%a.k.hutter[at]rug.nl%%%ahutter.pdf

Although essential, this period in the history of the Universe is still poorly known. We wonder about the sources: if it is generally admitted that the first stars led the process, more exotic sources such as the bright radiation of quasars might be needed. But also about the chronology: when were the first stars born? How efficient were they to ionise the IGM, what were their properties? Finally, about the topology: were overdense regions ionised first or last?... </p><p> In this talk, I'll give an overview of the different observational ways available to learn about cosmic reionisation, from astrophysics to cosmology, from galaxy and quasar spectra to the 21cm signal. I'll present the assumptions usually made to model reionisation and how they can impact the interpretation of observations.

The timeline of reionization is currently uncertain but if it is accurately measured it can unveil properties of 'first light' sources. I will describe how we can use galaxies at our current observational frontiers to learn about reionization. In particular, Lyman alpha (Ly&alpha;) emission from galaxies can be used to probe the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshift, but requires modelling physics from pc to Gpc scales. I will describe a forward-modelling Bayesian approach which combines cosmological IGM simulations with empirical interstellar medium models to constrain reionization from observations of galaxies, focusing on Ly&alpha; emission at z>6. I will present new measurements which favour a late and relatively rapid reionization, and place these in the context of high redshift galaxy formation.

20190722%%%14:15 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 6 Geoff Opat seminar room%%%Akanksha Kapahtia%%%Indian Institute of Astrophysics%%%Morphology of cosmological fields during the epoch of Reionization%%%Neutral hydrogen is the dominant component of the universe after recombination with high density regions harbouring the first luminous objects. The radiation from these first luminous objects changes the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium leading to a major transition in the history of the universe called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The EoR is marked by the appearance of ionized regions around these collapsed objects which grow and merge until the entire universe is ionized. The growth and topology of these ionized regions depends upon the properties of these first luminous sources. One important observational probe of the EoR is the 21cm spin flip hyperfine transition of the neutral hydrogen.  The brightness temperature of this transition encodes the ionization and heating history of the IGM. We introduce real space morphological descriptors, called Minkowski Tensors (MTs) and topological quantities Betti numbers, to probe the morphology of the 21cm brightness temperature field. The MTs provide shape and anisotropy information of the structures in the excursion set of the fields, while Betti numbers describe the topology in terms of the number of connected regions and holes.  We obtain different regimes of morphological evolution of brightness temperature, as the universe evolves depending upon different astrophysical settings of the EoR. Therefore, we show that the ionization history of the IGM can be reconstructed using the morphological description of brightness temperature in real space and help us further probe the properties of the first luminous objects.%%%-%%%-%%%akapahtia.png%%%-%%%akanksha.kapahtia[at]iiap.res.in%%%akapahtia.pdf

However, they produce reconstructed interferometric images that are limited in quality and scalability for big data. In this work, we demonstrate the use of computationally distributed state-of-the-art sparse image reconstruction algorithms which have been implemented in the PURIFY software package. We do this by applying PURIFY to real interferometric observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), where PURIFY out performs CLEAN in modelling structure shown by the residuals. Lastly, we use PURIFY in wide-field imaging at low frequencies, where the w-projection algorithm models wide-fields of view with the non-coplanar w-term.The required accuracy and computational cost of these corrections is one of the largest unsolved challenges facing next generation radio interferometers. We show that the same calculation can be performed with a radially symmetric w-projection kernel, where we use one dimensional adaptive quadrature to calculate the resulting Hankel transform, decreasing the computation required for kernel generation by several orders of magnitude, whilst preserving the accuracy. We demonstrate the potential of our radially symmetric w-projection kernel via sparse image reconstruction, using the software package PURIFY. We develop a distributed w-stacking and w-projection hybrid algorithm where we apply exact w-term corrections for each measurement from observations from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), showing that it allows full wide-field correction for real data sets.%%%-%%%-%%%lpratley.png%%%-%%%luke.pratley[at]gmail.com%%%lpratley

Initially, we recover the results shown by 21CMMC for the parameter estimation of 21cmFAST models. We proceed to test several toy models of the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) defined in contrasting morphology and scale. We find that LOFAR observations are unlikely to allow model selection even with long integration times. HERA would require 61 dipoles to perform the same analysis in 1080 hours, and becomes comparable to the SKA with 217 dipoles. We find the SKA requires only 324 hours of observation to conclusively distinguish between our models. Once model selection is achievable, an analysis of observational priors is performed finding that neutral fraction checks at specific redshifts add little to no inference. We show the difficulties in model selection at the level of distinguishing fiducial parameters within a model or distinguishing galaxies with a constant versus power law mass-to-light ratio. Finally, we explore the use of the Savage-Dickey density ratio to show the redundancy of the parameter Rmfp within 21cmFAST.%%%-%%%-%%%tbinnie.png%%%-%%%t.binnie16[at]imperial.ac.uk%%%tbinnie.pdf

Hubble observations have placed a now-commonly-held view that the intrinsically faint galaxies are responsible for driving the reionization process, but with a fundamental assumption of large escape fractions >10%. A further puzzle comes from the recent deep spectroscopy of luminous galaxies and the spatial opacity fluctuation of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z>5.7, which suggests a possibly important role of luminous systems and active galactic nuclei/quasars (QSOs). In the theoretical front, simulating early galaxies and the reionization process and is extremely challenging, requiring the understanding of the physics over a huge dynamic range from the scale of molecular clouds to the intergalactic medium. To shed light on these issues, we introduce a new spectroscopic programme surveying 5<z<7 Lyman-break galaxies around the Lyman alpha forest region of a background QSO to directly examine the correlation between galaxies and the physical state of the IGM, complemented by the detailed study of lower redshift analogues of reionization-era galaxies. We also discuss the future prospect for the 3D 21cm tomography of the reionization process and what can be learnt from the direct imaging beyond power spectra. The results demonstrate the potential of future large spectroscopic galaxy survey in z>6 QSO fields and a power of direct 3D mapping of galaxies and the IGM via 21cm tomography, which will be enabled by JWST, ELT, and SKA.%%%-%%%-%%%kkakiichi.png%%%-%%%k.kakiichi[at]ucl.ac.uk%%%kkakiichi.pdf

20190508%%%14:15 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr Emma Kerr%%%RMIT%%%Space situational awareness and general perturbations methods for orbit propagation%%%The problem posed by space debris has been internationally recognised and many different methods tackling both mitigation and remediation have been proposed. One fundamental challenge though is accurate tracking and position prediction of objects in orbit. Beyond improving technology, the only method for tackling this challenge is in improving orbit propagation method. Orbit propagation allows a user to predict where an object will be in the future given its current position. This research focusses on improving general perturbations methods for orbit propagation. General perturbations methods for orbit propagation are typically considered to be less accurate and/or less useful than their numerical counterparts. The major problem facing these methods in terms of accuracy is that it is very difficult to capture time dependant phenomena such as the solar activity cycle's effect on atmospheric density in a general perturbation solution. To date very little research on this topic has been published, as computers became more powerful it became less important to study such methods. However, as space debris has become such a prevalent issue, threatening the safety of both current and future missions, it has once again become prudent to look at methods that can allow the propagation of a large catalogue of objects in as computationally inexpensive way as possible.%%%-%%%-%%%ekerr.png%%%-%%%emma.kerr[at]rmit.edu.au%%%-

In this talk I will present various ways in which we can use galaxy redshift surveys to test theoretical models. In particular, using observables like Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift-space distortions, we can measure the cosmological parameters as well as test models of dark energy and modified gravity. The low statistical errors on cosmological parameters promised by future galaxy surveys will only be realised with the development of new, fast, analysis methods that reduce potential systematic problems to low levels.

I will present different methods to select galaxies in transition, showing how different approaches can reveal different pathways to quenching. \n - Transition galaxies can be identified as outliers in the  SFR-mass plane. I will focus on the cluster SFR-mass relation at z=0 and show that in some galaxies the star formation is enhanced, while in some others it is suppressed with respect to the field. The triggering of the star formation is due to fast gas removal processes, such as ram pressure stripping  (Vulcani+2018c), while its suppression is due to slow processes, such as strangulation (Paccagnella, Vulcani+2016). \n - Transition galaxies can be selected according to their spectral information. I will show how the incidence and the properties of post starburst galaxies, tracers of fast quenching processes,  depend on environment (Paccagnella, Vulcani+2017, 2018). \n - Transition galaxies can be selected using photometric information. I will also present an analysis of those galaxies that show signs of an ongoing or recent transformation of their star formation activity and/or morphology discussing an evolutionary scenario that links all the different populations at z=0 (Vulcani+15). \n These analyses are based on the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE (GASP) survey, the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS), its recent extension OmegaWINGS and the Padova Millennium Galaxy Group Catalog (PM2GC). %%%-%%%-%%%bvulcani.png%%%-%%%benedetta.vulcani[at]inaf.it%%%bvulcani.pdf

20190306%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr Matthew Baring%%%Rice University%%%Magnetar Magnetospheres under the Microscope%%%Magnetars are young neutron stars with high surface magnetic fields, exceeding around 10 TeraGauss. Pulsed, non-thermal quiescent X-ray emission extending between 10 keV to >150 keV has been observed in about 10 magnetars by RXTE, INTEGRAL, Suzaku, NuSTAR and Fermi-GBM. This talk describes a model for the generation of such hard X-ray signals, wherein the emission is produced by resonant Compton upscattering of soft thermal photons from the neutron star surface. This mechanism is efficient due to the enhancement of the scattering cross section at the cyclotron resonance. Spectra that approximately match observations can be generated by emission volumes within about ten stellar radii of the magnetar surface. The observed/implied maximum energies of these hard X-ray signals may require that an attenuation process such as magnetic photon splitting be active.  This prospect can be probed by future sensitive Compton telescopes with polarimetric capability, for example the AMEGO concept. Interestingly, key pulsation and spectral signatures can be used to constrain the viewing geometry and the angle between the magnetic and spin axes of magnetars, a diagnostic that may improve the ability to precisely determine the strengths of magnetar fields.%%%-%%%-%%%mbaring.png%%%-%%%baring[at]rice.edu%%%mbaring.pdf

However, the positional uncertainties make fast localisation of the electromagnetic counterpart extremely difficult. In order to address this concern, I use new rapid-response systems on Australian radio telescopes to rapidly and automatically obtain observations of transients. These systems allow telescopes to "trigger" on transient alerts, causing the telescope to automatically repoint and begin collecting data within minutes of discovery. For example, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) can be on-target within 14 seconds of receiving a trigger. Additionally, the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) can now be on-target within minutes. My main research focus is on the rapid follow-up of transients, particularly short-duration gamma-ray bursts, a known subclass of gravitational wave events that are well localised by the Swift telescope. MWA response times are fast enough to probe for prompt radio signals predicted to be produced by merging neutron star binaries, in-turn allowing us to test neutron star merger models. ATCA can be on-target to probe the reverse shock emission from gamma-ray bursts, allowing us to determine a template of the radio luminosities and temporal behaviour of the gravitational wave events that will be detected by aLIGO/Virgo. In this talk, I will discuss some of the early results from the MWA and ATCA rapid-response observations of transient events and how these experiements will contribute invaluable knowledge towards optimising transient science to be conducted with the Square Kilometre Array.%%%-%%%-%%%ganderson.jpg%%%-%%%gemma.anderson[at]curtin.edu.au%%%ganderson.pdf

I will explain how we go from the observed signal to making inferences about the source's parameters, such as a black hole's mass and spin. These properties are an insight into the processes that forged these compact objects. With a growing catalogue of observations, we can begin to constrain the properties of the population. This can help to pin down the uncertain physics of binary evolution. Making a binary black hole involves many processes that are currently poorly understood, such as stellar mass loss rates and the kicks imparted in supernova explosions. Once we have large numbers of detections, as expected following the upcoming observing runs, we can use mass and merger rate measurements to constrain the parameters describing these processes to a few percent. Adding in further information, such as the evolution of the merger rate with redshift will provide an even more detailed picture of the physics of binary evolution.%%%-%%%-%%%cberry.png%%%-%%%christopher.berry[at]northwestern.edu%%%cberry.pdf

20190213%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Assistant Prof. Sebastiano Cantalupo%%%ETH Zurich%%%Illuminating the Cosmic Web with Fluorescent Ly-alpha emission%%%Our standard cosmological model predicts that most of the matter in the universe is distributed into a network of filaments - the Cosmic Web - in which galaxies form and evolve. Because most of this material is too diffuse to form stars, its direct imaging has remained elusive for several decades leaving fundamental questions about the structure of the universe still open, including: How are galaxies linked to each other? What are the morphological and physical properties of the Cosmic Web on both large and small scales? How do galaxies accrete gas from the Cosmic Web? In this talk, I will tackle these questions using the results of a new program to directly detect and study high-redshift cosmic gas in emission using bright quasars and galaxies as external "sources of illumination". In particular, I will show results from ultra-deep narrow-band imaging and integral-field-spectroscopy with both MUSE/VLT and the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) that revealed numerous giant Lyman-alpha emitting filaments extending up to several hundred kpc around quasars and bright galaxies. I will discuss how the unexpectedly high luminosities of these systems, together with the constraints from Helium and metal extended emission, represent a challenge for our current understanding of cosmological structure formation. In particular, I will show that current observations suggest that intergalactic gas around high-redshift galaxies and quasars has a much broader density distribution of cold material than expected from cosmological simulations and I will present our first attempts to understand the origin and nature of these structures using high-resolution hydrodynamical models. At the same time, current galaxy formation models lack an efficient mechanism to prevent too much intergalactic gas cooling onto galaxies at later epochs and rely on very strong "ejective" feedback. In the final part of the talk (if time allows), I will show how the interaction between high-energy radiation from star-forming galaxies and the gas surrounding them provides a natural way to prevent "excessive" intergalactic gas cooling onto galaxies and I will discuss HST/COS observations that provide support for the importance of this effect.%%%-%%%-%%%scantalupo.png%%%-%%%cantalupo[at]phys.ethz.ch%%%-

However, it is unclear whether the declining star formation rates are simply the result of lower molecular gas masses, or whether the star formation efficiency has also evolved. In this talk I will discuss how the molecular gas contents of galaxies are measured and highlight the difficulties of doing so at high redshift.

Here we show that the transition from supersonic to subsonic turbulence - the sonic scale - may determine crucial properties of the filaments, such as their widths, and how the sonic scale enters our derivation of star formation rates. I will also present results from the world's largest supersonic turbulence simulation, in which we measure the sonic scale, from which the the filament width and critical density for star formation is derived.%%%-%%%Stromlo Fellow%%%cfederrath.png%%%-%%%christoph.federrath[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

One of the next frontiers of GW astrophysics is to detect and to characterize the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). A measurement of an astrophysical SGWB (like that caused by many unresolved compact binary mergers) could happen in the next few years with second generation detectors, but the ability to detect relic GWs, like those produced in many models of the early Universe, with third generation ground-based interferometric detectors will require significant improvements in strain sensitivity at frequencies below ~10 Hz. In this talk, I will broadly discuss the challenges in improving sensitivity at low frequencies before focusing on noise caused by local gravitational perturbations, known as Newtonian noise. Newtonian noise can be caused by density fluctuations in the Earth (seismic waves) and the atmosphere (density and temperature fluctuations) and current estimates suggest that it will likely be a limiting noise source for future GW detectors at low frequencies. I will discuss a 3-dimensional seismometer array at the former Homestake gold mine in Lead, SD, whose primary goal is to estimate and better understand Newtonian noise, and to develop techniques for mitigating it in future GW detectors.

K-M giant and supergiant stars are surrounded by a hot layer called the chromosphere, which likely powers Magneto-Hydrodynamic Alfven waves that drive their mass loss. Toward the end of their life, on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), stars produce heavy chemical elements, molecules, and dust, which, through the mass loss provided via their stellar winds, are placed into the interstellar medium.\n This talk will explore ongoing work modeling high-resolution spectroscopic observations with Hubble Space Telescope instruments (Rau et al. 2018, subm.), to reveal the role of the chromosphere in driving K-M giant and supergiant winds. Our results include estimates of wind and chromospheric parameters, mass-loss rates, and fundamental stellar parameters.\n In addition, ground-based interferometric measurements with high-angular resolution instruments from VLTI, such as MIDI (Rau et al. 2015, Rau et al. 2017) and GRAVITY (Wittkowski et al. 2018), helped to test geometrical and dynamical models describing the behavior of the outer AGB atmospheres at various spatial scales. In this way we are able to unravel the role of molecules and dust in their extended atmospheres.\n Future plans include the use of high-angular resolution instruments such as VEGA at CHARA, and MATISSE at VLTI, to better understand the behavior of cool stars outer atmospheres at various spatial scales. %%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%grau.jpg%%%-%%%gioia.rau@nasa.gov%%%grau.pdf

In recent years, redundant calibration has emerged as a potential solution to calibration errors associated with an incomplete sky model. We show that redundant calibration, like traditional sky-based calibration, is susceptible to errors from sky model incompleteness. These errors contaminate the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) signal and can preclude a measurement.\n Astrophysical foregrounds are 4-5 orders-of-magnitude brighter than the cosmological signal, but because they are spectrally smooth they are in principle separable. Unmitigated calibration errors can couple bright foreground emission to higher power spectrum modes, making an EoR signal detection impossible. Barry et al. 2016 identifies one class of systematic errors that emerge from calibrating to an incomplete sky model (N. Barry et al., Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 461, 2016). Missing sources in the sky model, along with their associated point spread functions, introduce chromatic calibration errors that contaminate the power spectrum modes sensitive to the EoR.\n Barry et al. 2016 explored these errors in the context of sky calibration, but it has been unclear if they also affect the calibration of redundant arrays. We present a mathematical framework to show that redundant calibration is vulnerable to errors from sky model incompleteness that emerge in the "absolute calibration" step, in which degenerate calibration parameters are calculated from a sky model. Using end-to-end power spectrum simulations with idealized radio arrays and sky models, we show that these errors can prevent an EoR detection even in the limit of perfect array redundancy and no thermal noise. Finally, we suggest error mitigation strategies with implications for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%rbyrne.png%%%-%%%rlbyrne@uw.edu%%%rbyrne.pdf

The young gas- and dust-rich circumstellar disks, also called protoplanetary disks, are the expected birthplace of planets. A fraction of these disks, referred to as transition disks, were identified to harbor inner clearings in their dust distribution, with some of these gaps extending over several dozens au, possibly due to dynamical carving by nascent giant planets. \nHere I will first provide a brief description of state-of-the-art high-contrast imaging techniques, and then discuss results obtained from their application to the search of direct signals from protoplanets in transition disks. I will also explain how the characterization of structures seen in transition disks (e.g. gaps, spiral arms) and disk kinematics can be used to provide independent mass constraints on young embedded companions. A brief overview of promising techniques and instruments for the field of planet formation will also be provided.%%%-%%%Research Fellow%%%vchristiaens.png%%%-%%%valentin.christiaens[at]monash.edu%%%vchristiaens.pdf

20181010%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Alex Saffer%%%Montana State University%%%The Exterior Spacetime of Relativistic Stars in Quadratic Gravity%%%General Relativity (GR) has been the cornerstone of gravitational physics for a century.  Over this time, numerous predictions and tests have strengthened the belief in GR as the foremost theory when discussing gravity.  However, GR cannot in its present form be reconciled with either quantum mechanics, or many cosmological observations such as galactic rotation curves or the accelerated expansion of the universe.  In an attempt to rectify these shortcomings, modified theories of gravity have been proposed.  In this talk, I will present one of these theories and discuss my current work in attempting to test its validity through the development of an exterior spacetime (metric) for a neutron star.  From this, we expect to be able to develop a pulse profile which can be used, in conjunction with observations made of the x-ray flux of radiating neutron stars, to place constraints on the theory.%%%-%%%Graduate Student%%%asaffer.jpeg%%%-%%%alexander.saffer[at]montana.edu%%%asaffer.pdf

With only a few detectors online, the poor directional resolution of the GW antennae network leaves hundreds of square degrees to be searched for associated transients. The large number of false-positives which simultaneously litter the sky represent a major challenge to reliably identify and link potential EM counterparts to GW events. In this talk, I will discuss the Gravitational-Wave Optical Transient Observatory (GOTO) which is dedicated to the follow-up of GW event triggers; as well as the ways in which we automatically detect and classify potential astrophysical transients using unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms on image-subtracted data. I will also discuss exciting research avenues with routine joint GW-EM observations, such as GW-EM parameter estimation, which may provide further constraints on the Hubble constant independent of the cosmological distance-ladder.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Research Fellow%%%kackley.jpg%%%-%%%kendall.ackley[at]monash.edu%%%kackley.pdf

These qualitative morphologies also inform us about the mass of the black hole residing at a spiral galaxy's centre. Specifically, spiral galaxies that typically possess the largest black holes have large bulges and tightly wound spiral arms. My research focusses on studying spiral galaxy structure and providing accurate, quantitative measurements of their bulge masses and logarithmic spiral arm pitch angles. I will present the details of my recent study of all the known supermassive black holes with directly measured dynamical masses in the literature. For this sample, I have measured their pitch angles and conducted extensive multicomponent decomposition analyses of their surface brightness profiles to determine accurate bulge masses. I will report on the resulting black hole mass scaling relations and discuss their usefulness in predicting unknown black hole masses to generate mass functions and identifying galaxies that might harbour intermediate mass black holes.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%bdavis.png%%%-%%%benjamindavis[at]swin.edu.au%%%bdavis.pdf

The short timescales associated with the quenching process make it difficult to catch galaxies "in the act" of shutting down their star formation. Compact star-forming galaxies, making-up ~7% of our sample, are selected to have properties aligned with already quenched galaxies at the same or lower redshifts but forming stars at rates 2-10x higher. We measure resolved kinematics of ~30 of these galaxies within the KMOS3D survey. Our results - the first resolved spectral data of such objects - show that compact star-forming galaxies are rotationally-dominated systems, providing strong evidence that recently quenched galaxies at these epochs are likely to be "fast rotators" . The majority of compact star-forming galaxies show evidence of low molecular gas fractions from ALMA observations and nuclear activity indicative of secular quenching processes that may retain the rotation observed in the star-forming phase. The KMOS3D survey, an integral field survey of over 600 galaxies at z=0.7-2.7 using KMOS at the VLT, will make their data public this year. In addition to the above science (Wisnioski et al. 2018) I will describe the survey and data products that will soon be available to the Australian community.%%%-%%%ASTRO 3D Fellow%%%ewisnioski.png%%%-%%%emily.wisnioski[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

I will examine the case for turbulence in neutron stars, comparing the conditions in these stars with those in known turbulent astrophysical systems.  Particular attention is given to instabilities arising from conditions unique to neutron stars, such as two-stream instabilities driven by the relative rotation between the proton and neutron condensates in the core.  We show that magnetic stresses have a stabilizing effect on these instabilities, making them unlikely to be connected with turbulence. %%%-%%%Postdoctoral Research Associate%%%aveysden.png%%%-%%%anthonyvaneysden[at]montana.edu%%%avaneysden.pdf

The observed field is consistent with a global ocean layer with a high dissolved salt content. However, ice layer thickness, ocean depth, and salinity determined from induced magnetic field measurements are dependent on the model applied to represent the interior structure. Past studies attempting to constrain ocean properties have all assumed spherical symmetry, which is not expected for Europa and restricts the validity of the derived constraints. Quantifying the degree of potential asymmetry in the ocean and ice layer is critical to future exploration. Interpretation of magnetic measurements by the upcoming Europa Clipper mission, especially considering plume activity that may have degenerate signals, may be impossible without asymmetric interior models. In this work, we aim to identify constraints on the spatial asymmetry that may be present in Europa's oceans. Constraints will be determined as extremes in low-order spherical harmonics describing the ice-ocean boundary that are consistent with Galileo gravity and magnetometer measurements and realistic ocean parameters, assuming uniform ocean conductivity. Preliminary results and plans for future work will be presented.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%mstyczinski.png%%%-%%%mjstyczi@uw.edu%%%-

20180816%%%14 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Opat room%%%Dr Lucy Forman%%%Curtin University%%% Exploring the effects of crystallographic orientation on shock features in Martian meteorites: how does the orientation of a crystal affect how it bends or breaks?%%% Shock features within Martian samples are thought to result primarily from the impact that launched them from the surface of Mars, and so exploring the material response can help constrain shock parameters, related impact processes and locate candidate launch craters on the Martian surface. Different minerals have varied material responses to stress and, more specifically in this case, the stress applied by a propagating shockwave. Slip systems must be activated in each grain so that the crystal lattice can be deformed. However, often the dominant activated slip system is dependent upon the orientation the stress is applied in, with relation to the crystallographic orientation of the grain, and the physical conditions of the material at the time of impact. Here we explore the effect of crystallographic orientation on the quantifiable amount of crystal deformation that is generated in an impact scenario on the Martian surface. \nThe initial focus of this study is the lherzolitic Shergottite Roberts Massif (RBT) 04262, which comprises poikilitic pyroxenes amongst a pyroxene and olivine-rich mineralogy. We initially examined a large (10 x 7 mm) twinned pyroxene grain. At the macro scale, shock is heterogeneous but no mineral phase changes have been observed, therefore overall shock is limited. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques were used to determine pyroxene orientation to constrain spectral characteristics and understand the style of deformation within the grains. The data comprise crystallographic information from all mineral phases at a step size of 12.2 µm.\n The twinned pyroxene grain is primarily pigeonite based on the composition, and was divided into twins A & B. Twin A shows very little internal deformation in the pigeonite region (<2 º), but a consistently greater amount of misorientation is present in the augite rim. However, twin B, which is twinned on the [001] plane with twin A, shows a variable amount of misorientation throughout the crystal, which appears to undulate in contrast to the radial trend in deformation in twin A.\n This sample has a very low porosity, which would have also been true at the time of impact, and therefore heterogeneities in shock are not due to shockwave interactions arising from interaction with pores. We subsequently infer the crystallographic orientation of each grain dictated the degree of crystal-plastic deformation generated by the shock wave. Further EBSD microstructural analysis will be used to constrain the slip systems that have been activated in the pigeonite, and subsequently constrain the physical conditions at the time of impact. This approach may allow determination of the shockwave propagation direction with respect to the plane of the sample. Further Martian samples have been investigated using this analytical approach. This study will contribute directly to our understanding of impact-induced deformation in a suite of rocks ejected from the Martian surface at the same time, and potentially by the same impact event.%%%-%%%Research Associate%%%lforman.png%%%-%%%lucy.forman[at]curtin.edu.au%%%-

Modelling the physical mechanism that produces these glitches is an endeavour that spans many scales: from the quantum mechanical, microscopic interaction of vortices in the superfluid interior to the macroscopic motion of the rigid stellar crust. We can simulate vortex-avalanche-induced glitches by constructing a Gross-Pitaevskii model from first-principles, thereby incorporating the microscopic physics of superfluid vortices (Warszawski, Melatos, 2011; Melatos, Douglass & Simula, 2015). A complementary approach is to model pulsar glitches as a state-dependent Poisson process, thereby capturing the global behaviour of glitching pulsars (Fulgenzi, Melatos & Hughes, 2017). Bridging the stellar and microscopic scales described in these two approaches is an enormous computational and theoretical challenge. These models can each be extended in various ways, for example by including the interaction with the proton superconductor in the core (Drummond & Melatos, 2017). Competition between vortex-vortex repulsion and vortex-flux-tube attraction (pinning) leads to "glassy" behaviour characterized by multiple metastable states spaced closely in energy. Vortex tangles emerge as a consequence of the frustration in the system. The tangles evolve in a complicated fashion when driven out of equilibrium and a three-dimensional investigation reveals new vortex behaviours for misaligned magnetic and rotation axes.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%ldrummond.jpg%%%-%%%l.drummond[at]student.unimelb.edu.au%%%-

But, there are still many intriguing sources that have yet to be detected, and these include continuous quasi-monochromatic signals from individual rapidly-rotating neutron stars. Known pulsars therefore are intriguing targets for searches for such signals. In this talk I will give an overview of searches for gravitational waves from pulsars using the LIGO and Virgo detectors. I will describe some recent work that may provide some evidence that millisecond pulsars have a minimum ellipticity, which makes detection of these sources more plausible with future gravitational detectors. I will also describe how hierarchical Bayesian inference can potentially be used to detect signals from an ensemble of pulsars and infer the distribution of pulsar ellipticities.%%%-%%%Post-doctoral Research Fellow%%%mpitkin.jpg%%%-%%%matthew.pitkin[at]glasgow.ac.uk%%%mpitkin.pdf

Observational constraints and numerical simulations increasingly favour the "direct collapse" scenario. In this case, an atomically-cooled halo of primordial composition accretes rapidly onto a single protostellar core, ultimately collapsing through the Chandrasekhar-Feynman instability to produce a supermassive (~100,000 solar mass) "seed" black hole. In this talk, I'll present a systematic study of the lives and deaths of these objects, using the 1D implicit hydrodynamics and stellar evolution code KEPLER. We include post-Newtonian corrections to gravity and a detailed treatment of nuclear burning processes using an adaptive network. We find a simple relation between the infall rate and the final mass at collapse, and rule out the existence of rapidly-rotating supermassive stars. I'll also discuss the possibility of early chemical enrichment from these objects, observational prospects in the era of the JWST, and briefly summarize other future directions agreed upon at our workshop "Titans of the Early Universe" held at the Monash Prato Centre in Italy, in November of last year.%%%-%%%Post-doctoral Research Fellow%%%twoods.jpg%%%-%%%tyrone.woods[at]monash.edu%%%twoods.pdf

However the detection of the redshifted 21cm signal is difficult due to the bright foregrounds. For mitigating the foreground contamination, the cross correlation with other observable is useful. Here, we predict the detectability of the cross power spectrum between 21cm signal and Lyman-alpha emitter (LAE) by using numerical reionization simulation and assuming ongoing and future observations. For 21cm observation, we assume radio survey by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The LAEs are detected at z=5.7, 6.6 and 7.3 by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC).  In this work, we find that the MWA can detect the signal by combining the spectroscopic survey with the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). In practice, however, the error of cross power spectrum is dominated by the foregrounds, and moderate foreground removal is required.%%%-%%%-%%%syoshiura.png%%%-%%%161d9002[at]st.kumamoto-u.ac.jp%%%-

However, when it comes to studying their properties as a function of redshift and/or environment, the most-detailed studies tend to be limited by small-number statistics. In this talk, I will present a new sample of nearly 2,000 of the brightest radio-sources in the southern hemisphere (Dec. < 30 deg). These were observed at low radio-frequencies as part of the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, conducted using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). Being brighter than 4 Jy at 151 MHz, we refer to these objects as "The GLEAM 4-Jy Sample". Thanks to the location of the MWA in a protected, radio-quiet zone, we have excellent spectral coverage for these sources, with 20 radio flux-densities spanning a frequency range of 72-231 MHz. A key component of this project is identifying the appropriate host galaxy of the radio emission, with these positions feeding into target lists for the Taipan Galaxy Survey. Having 10 times as many sources as the most-prominent, low-frequency radio-source sample that is optically complete (the revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources; 3CRR), the GLEAM 4-Jy Sample will allow models of powerful active galactic nuclei to be tested more robustly.%%%-%%%Research Associate%%%swhite.jpg%%%-%%%Sarah.White1[at]curtin.edu.au%%%swhite.pdf

Using a Bayesian parameter estimatin pipeline, we characterize a method for detecting evidence of precession.

We investigate the balance between the heating by stellar radiation, and neutral gas cooling dominated by [CII] emission line. [CII] is typically the brightest far-IR emission line from star-forming galaxies, and it has been proven to be a useful SFR tracer, both locally and at high redshifts, however, with some vital caveats. Specifically, we are interested wheather there are any changes in the efficiency of the photoelectric heating (PEeff), the dominant heating mechanism of the neutral gas, that might affect reliability of the [CII] as a SFR tracer.  To address these issues, we have assembled a unique set of observations in two nearby galaxies, M31 and M51. Multi wavelength FUV-FIR photometric coverage enables a well constrained SED modelling. Key observations of [CII] emission at high, 50pc, resolution in five SF regions in M31 (Herschel), and the first fully mapped galaxy at ~650pc resolution in M51 (SOFIA), enable a local and a global studies.  Finally, we model individually resolved stars with 6 band HST photometry down to spectral type F0 with PHAT survey in M31 using BEAST (Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool) for an independent measurement of the heating at smallest scales. A commonly used ratio [CII]/TIR (total IR emission), fails as a proxy for PEeff, because the TIR measures all dust heating, not just the FUV photons capable of ejecting electrons from dust grains (Kapala et al. 2017). We find [CII]/TIR to be strongly correlated with UVatt/TOTatt (inferred from MAGPHYS SED fitting), indicating that, in M31 at least, one of the dominant drivers for [CII]/TIR variation is the relative hardness of the absorbed stellar radiation field. We define PEeff(UV), [CII]/UVatt which should be more closely related to the true PE efficiency, which we find to be essentially constant (1.85 &plusmn 0.8%) in all explored 700x700pc fields in M31, regardless of the value of [CII]/TIR (varying by a factor of 3). I will present the above findings and the preliminary results of the [CII] - SFR relation, and the PEeff(UV) on 650pc scales in M51. I will also explore environmental dependencies on those relations.%%%-%%%SARChI Postdoctoral Fellow%%%mkapala.jpg%%%-%%%kapala[at]ast.uct.ac.za%%%-

20180328%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr Jade Powell%%%Swinburne University%%%Parameter Estimation and Model Selection of Gravitational Wave Signals Contaminated by Transient Detector Noise Glitches%%%The number of astrophysical sources detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo is expected to increase as the detectors approach their design sensitivity. Gravitational wave detectors are also sensitive to transient noise sources created by the environment and the detector, known as `glitches'. As the rate of astrophysical sources increases, the probability that a signal will occur at the same time as a glitch also increases. This has occurred previously in the gravitational wave binary neutron star merger detection GW170817. In this talk, we examine the effect of glitches on the measurement of signal parameters and Bayesian model selection. We include binary black holes similar to current detections, sine Gaussian bursts, and core-collapse supernovae. We examine if the effects of glitches are worse when there is a mis-match between the signal model and the data.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%jpowell.jpg%%%-%%%jpowell[at]swin.edu.au%%%jpowell.pdf

By de-redshifting and scaling photometry of many tens to hundreds of galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions, we can create low resolution spectra (R~50), quantifying features such as emission line equivalent widths with more precision than possible for a single galaxy without spectroscopy. In this talk I will detail the use of this method with ~7000 high signal to noise galaxies from the ZFOURGE survey. This allows us to identify and characterize populations of galaxies in the green valley, which show morphologies, dust content, and star formation rates between those of star-forming and quenched populations. I will also discuss those galaxies with extreme nebular emission in the young universe, which may be analogs to those which played a role in cosmic reionization.%%%-%%%PhD student%%%bforrest.jpg%%%-%%%bforrest[at]physics.tamu.edu%%%bforrest.pdf

There is mounting evidence that these bright, dispersed pulses of radio emission originate at cosmological (gigaparsec) distances.  Not only do the energetics of the events point to a new radiative process, but the pulses are imprinted with propagation through the ionised intergalactic medium and cosmic web, making them invaluable probes of media invisible to most other types of observations.   Despite considerable effort to detect additional bursts, the yields have been low because of relatively narrow fields of view of most searches.  Here I will present the discovery of 20 FRBs from a wide-area survey conducted with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP),  nearly doubling the total number of known FRBs in only one year of surveying.  The burst properties suggest a cosmologically evolving population with a wide luminosity function.    I will then discuss future plans to develop interferometric fast transient capabilities with ASKAP, necessary to harness the full value of FRBs.    To conclude, I will present the very recent discovery of two FRBs with the  Parkes telescope, one of which is the highest signal-to-noise ratio burst seen to date.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%rshannon.JPG%%%-%%%Ryan.Shannon[at]csiro.au%%%rshannon.pdf

Globular cluster formation tells us about the conditions of extreme star formation while their survival from high redshift tell us about the processes of galaxy assembly. Being much brighter than red giant stars, globular clusters allow the stellar populations of galaxies to be studied at much greater distances. Thus a wider range of galaxy masses, environments and morphologies to be studied than can be with resolved stars. Using data from the WAGGS survey of massive star clusters in the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies and the SLUGGS survey of the globular cluster systems of massive early-type galaixes, I will talk about how we can measure the metallicities of globular clusters using the strength of the calcium triplet in integrated light. Using globular cluster metallicity distributions and the relationships between globular cluster colour and metallicity, I will present evidence that different galaxies with similar masses experienced different formation histories. I will compare these observations with the predictions of the E-MOSAICS cosmological simulations of the formation of globular cluster systems. I will also talk about how the E-MOSAICS simulations have allowed to us to understand how globular cluster colour distributions vary with globular cluster luminosity (the 'blue tilt').%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Research Assistant %%%cusher.jpg%%%-%%%c.g.usher[at]ljmu.ac.uk%%%-

To produce He II ionizing photons, stellar populations require sources of hard ionizing radiation with energies >= 54.4 eV and sources such as AGN, shocks, X-Ray binaries, stellar rotation and/or binary stellar evolution, and post-AGB stars have been suggested as possible contributors. To accurately identify relative contributions from these wide variety of sources, high signal-to-noise spectra with rest-frame UV/optical coverage and advanced stellar population/photoionization models are required.<p>The VLT/MUSE GTO program has obtained deep &asymp;10-30h exposures of the Hubble legacy fields yielding rest-UV spectra of galaxies at z&asymp;2-6.

One such epoch is "cosmic dawn", when the first luminous objects lit up the universe, a few hunDred million years after the big bang. The radiation from first stars heated the intergalactic medium, imprinting a characteristic signature in the evolution of the globally averaged 21-cm signal when observed as a function of frequency. The 21-cm spectrum is expected to have a ~100 mK absorption feature at a redshift of approximately 20 (frequency of ~70 MHz). This dip corresponds to the heating of the ambient neutral hyDrogen by the first stars and is observationally undetected to date.</p><p>We present a new global signal experiment called Probing Radio Intensity at high-Z from Marion (PRIZM).

The Advanced LIGO detectors were joined by the Advanced Virgo detector in the recently concluded second observing run (O2). Another two binary black hole mergers, GW170104 and GW170814, have been announced so far from this analysis, with the analysis of the data ongoing. These observations confirmed the existence of merging stellar mass black hole binaries originating in low metallicity environments. How to form merging binary black holes remains an open question theoretically. There are many proposed mechanisms, falling broadly into two families: 1) Isolated binary evolution and 2) dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. We show that comparing the distribution of observed black hole masses and spins to those predicted from population models will allow us to gain insight into how binary black holes form. We examine the measurements of the effective spin parameters for the 5 binary black hole observations published thus far and show that the data already exhibit a mild (2.7 sigma) preference for an isotropic distribution of spins over spins aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes in these systems could be intrinsically small (average spin magnitude < 0.2), at odds with measurements of black hole spin magnitudes in high mass X-ray binaries. Both of these conclusions have implications for the formation of binary black holes, and the formation of heavy black holes in supernovae.%%%-%%%OzGrav postdoctoral fellow%%%sstevenson.jpg%%%-%%%spstevenson[at]swin.edu.au%%%sstevenson.pdf

Stranger still, another NYT writer later reported that the film rights had been taken up, and that Tom Hanks had been invited to play Sandage. No movie was made, however, and the controversy was cleared up a few years later by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The age of the expanding universe is now known to an accuracy of a few percent.</p><p>There is now a new urgency for increased accuracy in measurements of the Hubble Constant, the misnomer for the current epoch value of the accelerating expansion rate. Stellar Populations and the Distance Scale, sometimes called the distance ladder, as it ascends from the geometric diameter of the Earth's orbit, has been joined by a rival ladder, descending from the surface of last scattering of the cosmic background radiation. They were expected to meet in the middle, but there seems to be a gap. Or is there? If there is, the standard model of cosmology, the Nobel prize winning &Lambda;CDM model, may be lacking something important. Is it another neutrino, curvature, or a dark matter-neutrino interaction? Right now, the jury is out, and the race for better data is on. Volume simulations indicate that sample variance is not an issue. Are supernovae really standard candles? The OzDES survey is adDressing this issue.</p><p>The Hubble Constant from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is a standard ruler, rather than a standard candle like supernovae. The ruler is simply the sound horizon at recombination. Simulations tell us that the linear regime for the evolution of structure pertains, and the ruler is unchanged in length in comoving coordinates to a fraction of a percent over the life of the Universe. The Taipan project is expected to achieve 1% accuracy in H0 (1&sigma;) from redshifts of over a million galaxies in the next 5 years. Between the high redshift of BAO and the low redshift of the Local Group, the Hubble Constant can be measured using gravitational lensing with no reference to stars. The H0liCow collaboration has results in agreement with the stellar pops distance scale. A convincing next step would be two independent stellar populations distance scales (Pop I & Pop II) agreeing to 1%.</p>%%%-%%%Professor%%%jmould.jpg%%%jmould_fig.jpg%%%jmould[at]swin.edu.au%%%-

For this purpose, we set up the physical conditions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the redshift of the EoR, and we post-process the simulations to implement a uniform UV ionizing background for quasars and galaxies (Haardt-Madau 2012), the metal ions with CLOUDY 8.1 and HI self-shielding prescription (Rahmati et al. 2013). We use Voigt profile fitting to compute the column densities of the ions from the synthetic spectra and obtain a statistical distribution of the absorbers. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the state of the IGM at high redshift, compute the cosmological mass density of CIV and HI and other ions.  Our simulations produce absorbers properties that are in good agreement with observations in the literature, especially for the high ionization species.<p>Furthermore, we are able to reproduce an observed example of an LAE galaxy-CIV absorber pair at z=5.7, proving a physical insight into such systems beyond the limit of current observations. Finally, we vary of the uniform UVB at z~6, and compare directly with observations of different metal ions, in order to constrain the ionizing background at the tail of Reionization.%%%-%%%PhD student%%%langela.jpg%%%-%%%lgarcia[at]swin.edu.au%%%agarcia.pdf

Together the HST WFC3/IR and ACS cameras have opened up the exploration of the universe in the first billion years after the Big Bang.  I will discuss what we have learned about the earliest galaxies during the reionization epoch at z>6 from the remarkable HST and Spitzer imaging surveys (e.g., HUDF/XDF, GOODS, HUDF09/12 and CANDELS), as well as surveys of galaxy clusters like the Frontier Fields (HFF). Lensing clusters provide extraordinary opportunities for characterizing the faintest earliest galaxies, but also present extraordinary challenges. Together these surveys have reliably established the volume density of galaxies in the first billion years down to extremely faint levels around -14.5 mag. The results from deep UV luminosity functions from Hubble, combined with the recent results from Planck, indicate that galaxies dominate the UV ionizing flux that reionized the universe. Some of the greatest surprises have come from the discovery of very luminous galaxies at z~8-11, around 400-650 million years after the Big Bang. Spectroscopic followup of these very rare, bright galaxies has confirmed redshifts from z~7 to z~11, and revealed, surprisingly, strong Ly&alpha; emission near the peak of reionization when the HI fraction in the IGM is high. The small sizes of galaxies at high redshifts, from analysis of the HFF cluster samples, reveal objects that, remarkably, are as small as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. The recent confirmation of a z=11.1 galaxy, just 400 million years after the Big Bang, by a combination of Hubble and Spitzer data, pushed Hubble into JWST territory, far beyond what we ever expected Hubble could do.  Twenty years of astonishing progress with Hubble and Spitzer leave me looking to JWST to provide even more remarkable exploration of the realm of the first galaxies at "Cosmic Sunrise".  The latest results on the sizes of distant galaxies, on the star formation rate density at z~10 and from Planck indicating that reionization began around z~10 together have significant implications for the detectability of the "first galaxies" with JWST.%%%-%%%Professor%%%gillingworth.jpg%%%-%%%gedi[at]ucolick.org%%%gillingworth.pdf

Conversely, a highly skilled, network of tech-savvy astronomers, brings enormous benefits to data-intensive astronomy research, for example better-handing of SKA, LSST and JWST data processing and products, data analysis and web-based tools to maximise early science discoveries and societal impact.</p><p>The ADASS, Python in Astronomy; .Astronomy ("dot astro"); Astro Hack Week; AAS, NAM and SPIE Hack Days, SciCoder and ANITA workshops bring together a diverse community of astronomers, instrument scientists, software developers, data archivists, wranglers, and educators. They provide a forum for discussing the latest tech tools, sharing skills and increasing digital literacy, promoting best practises in scientific computing, and the opportunity for astronomers to create innovative research and outreach tools in a collaborative environment. I will show how momentum is slowly building in this space; from bridging the gap between research astronomers, instrument scientists, and software developers; to increasing engagement  (and in some cases collaboration) with the tech industry, enhancing everyday astronomy research projects, and providing early and mid-career researchers with the critical tech and data science skills needed for careers in other sectors.</p><p>The Tech Savvy Astronomer (<a href='https://techsavvyastronomer.io/' target='_blank'>techsavvyastronomer.io</a>) website was created in response to the .Astronomy ("dotastro") and Astro Hack Week conferences, and the growing need for community resources. Following the talk there will be an optional 2 hour workshop to introduce you to tools that could help your research or kickstart a new tech project. Please bring your laptop, enthusiasm and ideas.</p>%%%-%%%Consultant%%%akarick.jpg%%%-%%%arnakarick[at]gmail.com%%%akarick.pdf

For most extragalactic sources, this estimation relies on photometric redshifts which require strong assumptions and can lead to catastrophic failures. In this talk I will explain how it is possible to use clustering measurements to infer redshifts for virtually any type of extragalactic sources. I will show how to turn this idea into a new tool for redshift estimation and show how accurate it is. I will then present applications of this "clustering-redshift" technique to various datasets at UV, optical, IR and radio wavelengths.%%%-%%%Faculty member%%%bmenard.jpeg%%%-%%%menard[at]jhu.edu%%%bmenard.pdf

It will use the newly-refurbished 1.2-metre UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory with the new TAIPAN instrument, which includes an innovative 'Starbugs' positioning system capable of rapidly and simultaneously deploying up to 150 spectroscopic fibres over the 6-degree diameter focal plane, and a purpose-built spectrograph. The main scientific goals of Taipan are: (i) to measure the distance scale of the Universe (primarily governed by the local expansion rate, H0) to 1% precision, and the structure growth rate of structure to 5%; (ii) to make the most extensive map yet constructed of the mass distribution and motions in the local Universe, using peculiar velocities based on improved Fundamental Plane distances, which will enable sensitive tests of gravitational physics; and (iii) to deliver a legacy sample of low-redshift galaxies as a unique laboratory for studying galaxy evolution as a function of mass and environment. The Taipan survey will be the primary redshift and optical spectroscopic reference catalogue for the local Universe over the southern sky.%%%-%%%Director.

Over the last 5 decades, these laboratories have provided numerous breakthroughs, particular in the study of gravitation, where radio pulsar timing provided the first indirect evidence of gravitational waves and is poised to detect the low-frequency gravitational wave background created by binary supermassive black holes. What is remarkable is that so much of this progress has been made despite huge gaps in our knowledge about the laboratories themselves! In this talk I will discuss some of these gaps, the ongoing efforts to fill them in, and what the implications the success or failure of these efforts will have on future radio pulsar science with (for instance) the Square Kilometre Array.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow, Senior Lecturer%%%adeller.jpeg%%%-%%%adeller[at]astro.swin.edu.au%%%adeller.pdf

20170614%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr Alessia Moretti%%%INAF-OaPD%%%Star formation quenching in cluster galaxies from integrated and spatially resolved spectra%%%The distribution of galaxy properties such as colors, morphologies, and star formation rates is broadly bimodal, with early type galaxies being statistically red and quiescent, and late type galaxies being blue and actively star forming. When, why and how galaxies become passive is a crucial question in modern astrophysics, and might be related to both the galaxy intrinsic properties, and to the environment in which galaxies live. In particular, the cluster/denser environments are particularly efficient in quenching the star formation and therefore represent an ideal place where investigating galaxy properties. I will present the results that we obtained by studying a large sample of low-redshift clusters for which we have been able to characterize the different populations of galaxies on their way to become passive. I will also report on the Eso GASP Large Program, that is devoted to the study of a sample of cluster and field galaxies that show signatures of gas stripping at various degrees. GASP makes use of the MUSE IFU spectrograph at VLT, and has already observed ~50% of its targets. I will show the results that we have obtained so far for jellyfish galaxies, and I will briefly report on the emerging connection between jellyfish galaxies and AGN activity in cluster galaxies.%%%-%%%Faculty%%%Moretti.png%%%Gas_Quenching_diagram.jpg%%%alessia.moretti[at]oapd.inaf.it%%%amoretti.pdf

20170607%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 6 Geoff Opat room%%%Dr David Parkinson%%%University of Queensland%%%Testing for tensions between datasets%%%In cosmology, as in other areas of astrophysics, we are constrained to make observations of unrepeatable events (such as the Big Bang), and so have to proceed by statistical inference. The Bayesian approach  involves treating models and parameters similarly to data, as unknown variables with their own underlying probability distributions. However, as data from cosmological observables increases in constraining power, the opportunity arises for tensions between the different data sets, where the statistical limits on derived on certain parameters appears not to be coincident. This tensions can be generated either by an insufficient model, and so indicates the presence of new physics, by undiagnosed systematic errors, or simply by random statistical chance. In my talk I discuss different methods for diagnosing tensions, and show how these have been applied to the observed parameter tension between the cosmic microwave background data and measurements of the weak lensing shear power spectrum.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow, Senior Lecturer%%%dparkinson.jpg%%%-%%%d.parkinson[at]uq.edu.au%%%dparkinson.pdf

20170531%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr Tiantian Yuan%%%Australian National University%%%Spiral Arm Formation at Redshift 2%%%One of the most common features of disk galaxies in the local universe is the presence of prominent spiral arms.   Despite major developments in the 1960s and decades of studies, we still don't know what the necessary and sufficient conditions are for spiral arm formation.  Current efforts on the theory of spiral arm formation primarily focus on testing variations of density wave or swing amplifications on nearby galaxies.  Progress in this field is slow.  Breakthroughs can come from observations of high-redshift galaxies when spiral arms are in the early stage of formation.  In this talk, I will present my first results on integral field spectroscopic observations of the most ancient spiral galaxies at z>2, including gravitationally lensed galaxies.  The high-spatial resolution kinematic fields imply a population of rare spiral galaxies living in dynamically cold environments at high redshift.  I will discuss how ongoing follow-up IFS observations on a larger sample of spiral galaxies at z>2 can help to constrain the earliest onset mechanisms for spiral arms.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%yuantt.jpg%%%sprialarm.jpg%%%tiantian.yuan[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

20170524%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr Camila Correa%%%Leiden University%%%Morphology and color of EAGLE galaxy population%%%I investigate the dependence of kinematic-based galaxy morphology on intrinsic u-r colours and stellar mass in the EAGLE cosmological hyDrodynamical simulations. I use the intrinsic colours and measured the fraction of kinetic energy invested in ordered rotation of 3562 galaxies at z=0 with stellar masses larger than 10^10 solar masses. I find that EAGLE produces a galaxy population whose morphology correlates with the colour bimodality for central and satellite galaxies alike. The red-sequence is mostly populated elliptical-type galaxies and most of blue-cloud galaxies are disc-type. I analyse gri-composite images of orderly rotating galaxies and show that many resolve a disc structure and spiral arms. These results show that the connection between mass, intrinsic colour and morphology arise naturally from galaxy formation models able to reproduce observed star formation relations and galaxy abundance distributions. In this talk I will discuss these findings, and use galaxy morphology (that holds clue to past merger history) and the galaxy distribution on the color-mass diagram to disentangle different evolutionary paths. In particular I will focus on the origin of red-sequence galaxies.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%ccorrea.jpeg%%%EagleHubble.jpg%%%cami.acorrea[at]gmail.com%%%-

Signatures of the baryon cycle such as IGM accretion, minor mergers, and stellar-Driven outflows and fountains are best probed in gaseous halos, i.e., the circumgalactic medium (CGM). I use Keck, VLT, and HST spectra of background quasars to examine the geometric and kinematic properties of the multiphase, metal-enriched CGM of galaxies at 0.08&lt;z&lt;1.0, focusing on the low-ionization MgII and high-ionization OVI absorption doublets. By examining the velocity dispersions of absorbers in the context of the host galaxy color and orientation, I find that the low-ionization gas strongly traces expected baryon cycle processes. In contrast, high-ionization gas tends towards broader kinematics independent of galaxy color and orientation. These results suggest that the low- and high-ionization phases may trace different components of the CGM and provide observational constraints on simulations to accurately model the role that the baryon cycle plays in galaxy evolution.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%nnielsen.jpg%%%cgm.jpg%%%nikolenielsen[at]swin.edu.au%%%nnielsen.pdf

I will present work on the relationship between galaxies and metals seen in absorption towards higher redshift quasars. The relationship is investigated in two ways: globally and with individual galaxy-absorber pairs. We find that the Drop in the cosmic mass density of triply ionized Carbon, Omega(CIV), to redshift 5.5 cannot solely be explained by a decrease in the mean metallicty of the Universe over a short period of time. An additional change in the ionizing Background is required, in line with findings of increased neutrality of hyDrogen at the same redshift. Our analysis of galaxy-absorber pairs finds that low luminosity galaxies close to the quasar line of sight are the most likely source of metal absorbers at these redshifts.%%%Special Date%%%Associate Professor%%%eweber.jpg%%%Reionization-timeline.jpg%%%eryanweber[at]swin.edu.au%%%eweber.pdf

However, due to cooling, gas that accretes onto haloes and filaments does not always heat to the virial temperature, leading to unstable, free falling gas (a.k.a "cold flows"). I will summarize old theoretical results about accretion onto haloes, and present some recent work of gas accretion onto filaments. Once cold flows penetrate through hot virialized haloes, supersonic Kelvin Helmholtz instability occurs, with specific patterns of unstable KH modes. Finally, as cold flows smash into the galaxy, magnetic fields can play a non-trivial role in the way this gas actually mixes with the ISM.%%%-%%%Senior Lecturer%%%no_image.png%%%-%%%yuval[at]phys.huji.ac.il%%%ybirnboim.pdf

Second, I will discuss how underdense regions provide interesting tests of the cosmological model, and how we can constrain departures from GR in void profiles using Monte Carlo random walks.  Finally, I will discuss tests of gravitational physics by measuring the growth rate of large-scale structure in different environments. In particular I will present the first constraint from the void-galaxy cross correlation function in the 6dF Galaxy Survey.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%iachitouv.jpg%%%BAO.jpg%%%iachitouv[at]swin.edu.au%%%iachitouv.pdf

On the other hand, the amplitude of the cross-correlation is found to be higher than expected from the standard &Lambda;CDM model. The robustness of the results is tested against possible systematic effects however none of them can fully account for the enhanced cross-correlation signal.</p>%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%fbianchini.jpg%%%FB_xcorr.png%%%federico.bianchini[at]unimelb.edu.au%%%fbianchini.pdf
