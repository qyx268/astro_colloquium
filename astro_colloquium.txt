20220406%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Yisheng Qiu%%%Zhejiang University%%%Starduster: A multi-wavelength SED model based on radiative transfer simulations and deep learning%%%In this talk, I will introduce Starduster, a supervised deep learning model that predicts the multi-wavelength SED from galaxy geometry parameters and star formation history by emulating dust radiative transfer simulations. The model is comprised of three specifically designed neural networks, which take into account the features of dust attenuation and emission. We utilise the Skirt radiative transfer simulation to produce data for the training data of neural networks. Each neural network can be trained using ∼4000−5000 samples. Compared with the direct results of the Skirt simulation, our deep learning model produces 0.1−0.2 mag errors in FUV to FIR wavelengths. At some bands, the uncertainty is only 0.01 mag. As an application, we fit our model to the observed SEDs of IC4225 and NGC5166. Our model can reproduce the observations, and successfully predicts that both IC4225 and NGC5166 are edge-on galaxies. However, the predicted geometry parameters are different from image-fitting studies. Our analysis implies that the inconsistency is mainly due to the degeneracy in the star formation history of the stellar disk and bulge. In addition, we find that the predicted fluxes at 20μm−80μm by our SED model are correlated with bulge radius. Our SED code is public available and can be applied to both SED-fitting and SED-modelling of galaxies from semi-analytic models.%%%-%%%-%%%yqiu.png%%%-%%%yishengq[at]126.com%%%yqiu.mp4

20220330%%%12:00 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 Conference Room (+Zoom)%%%Dr Ben Wibking%%%ANU%%%Cosmological parameters from galaxy clustering and weak lensing on ~Megaparsec scales%%%Since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe, a fundamental question for physics has been the nature of this acceleration - is it consistent with a cosmological constant, cold dark matter Universe governed by General Relativity? One of the most precise probes of this is weak gravitational lensing. This can be combined with galaxy clustering and examined on nonlinear scales to obtain very precise measurements of cosmological parameters. I present constraints from galaxy clustering and weak lensing on ~Megaparsec scales using the galaxy catalogue from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. I show that these data lead to a statistically significant tension in the amplitude of matter fluctuations at low redshift compared to that measured by the Planck cosmic microwave background satellite.%%%-%%%-%%%bwibking.jpg%%%-%%%ben.wibking[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

That number is expected to increase significantly over the coming years as these experiments become even more sensitive. The increased number of detections, and the improved sensitivity of these instruments, allows us to probe the ultra-strong regime of gravity, as well as the formation history of these systems. I will discuss ongoing efforts to test general relativity in the ultra strong-field regime, including tests of the no-hair theorem and searches for gravitational-wave memory -- a permanent deformation of spacetime following the passage of a gravitational wave. I will also discuss efforts to detect orbital eccentricity in these systems, which has led to potentially the first observation of a second-generation black hole merger.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow%%%plasky.jpg%%%-%%%Paul.Lasky[at]monash.edu%%%plasky_2022.pdf

This talk will focus on the key science goals of 4HS (which I co-PI with Ned Taylor) and how this connects to my work using WISE and MeerKAT to a) create a benchmark view of the nearby universe, and b) investigate how environment influences the properties of galaxies.

Thus the environmental dependence of dark matter halo properties prompts a correlation between galaxy properties and the environment. In this talk, I will discuss the results from our recent works (arXiv:2102.04177 and arXiv:2201.10480) that explored how luminosities in various passbands and the associated galaxy properties are correlated with the environment. We used a set of 3.4 micro-m luminosity-selected and stellar mass-selected galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We made use of the galaxy two-point correlation functions and marked correlation functions to investigate the environmental correlations. I will also discuss the impact of various selection effects on the galaxy clustering measurements.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%usureshkumar.jpg%%%-%%%ukp1513[at]gmail.com%%%usureshkumar.mp4

20220302%%%2:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Assistant Prof Yuichi Harikane%%%Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, the University of Tokyo%%%Observing Cosmic Evolution of Galaxies at z~2-13 with Subaru and JWST%%%Studying the statistical properties of high redshift galaxies is crucial for understanding the overall picture of galaxy formation and evolution. In this talk, I will present our latest results from ~4,000,000 galaxies at z~2-7 identified in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. This large sample has allowed us to reveal 1) rest-frame UV luminosity functions in a very wide luminosity range, 2) the number density excess of bright galaxies beyond the classical Schechter function, and 3) the almost constant star formation efficiency at z~2-7, suggesting that the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density is primarily driven by the structure formation and the cosmic expansion. Extrapolation of this result to higher redshifts suggests a sharp decline of the star formation rate density at z>10, which is consistent with our recent finding of z~13 galaxy candidates and will be directly tested with JWST. Finally, I will briefly introduce our planned JWST Cycle 1 observations.%%%-%%%-%%%yharikane.jpg%%%-%%%hari[at]icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp%%%yharikane.pdf

Nugroho%%%Astrobiology Center, National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS), Japan%%%Peeking the Atmosphere of Ultra-hot Jupiters through High-resolution Spectroscopy%%%Using high-resolution spectroscopy, the atomic/molecular bands in the spectrum of an exoplanet are resolved into individual absorption lines. The variation of Doppler shifts caused by the planet’s orbital motion enables absorption lines in the exoplanet spectrum to be distinguished from telluric lines. By combining thousands of unique absorption (or emission) lines, the atomic/molecular signatures can be identified unambiguously and detected at high significance. As it is sensitive to the position of the lines, it also allows us to measure the planetary rotation and wind velocity, as well as search for atmospheric variability and inhomogeneity during the transit. In this talk, I will give a review on how we characterise the atmosphere of exoplanets using high-resolution spectroscopy including some of the latest discoveries in the atmosphere of ultra-hot Jupiters.%%%-%%%-%%%snugroho.jpg%%%-%%%stevanus.nugroho[at]nao.ac.jp%%%snugroho.pdf

In this talk, I will try to explain the link between these processes and how they shape the structure of molecular clouds, paving the way towards star formation. A lot of this is based on supercomputer simulations and theoretical models, however, the design of the simulations and theoretical models is ultimately guided by observational evidence.%%%-%%%Future and Stromlo Fellow%%%cfederrath.png%%%-%%%christoph.federrath[at]anu.edu.au%%%cfederrath.pdf

20220202%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Anitha Ravishankar%%%University of Calgary%%%Kinematics of coronal mass ejections and Auroral Science%%%An accurate understanding of the propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial in the prediction of space weather. CMEs generate geomagnetic storms causing catastrophic damages to power grids on Earth and are serious radiation threat to satellites on low-Earth orbit and their crew during spacewalks. Basic parameters such as their velocity and acceleration varying with time and heliospheric distance away from the Sun gives researchers the opportunity to predict their arrival time in the vicinity of the Earth. Once these clouds of charged particles reach the Earth, aurorae or Northern/Southern lights are generated at higher latitudes. Extreme geomagnetic storms (kp>4) are a matter of concern and also contribute to a beautiful sight with intense auroras. Ground based riometers have proven to be an efficient way to detect these KeV electron precipitation in the ionosphere during auroral formation. Absorption profiles offer a good approach towards studying various associated parameters and eventually help in building a model for predicting these events. In today’s talk I shall cover the cause & effect of these geomagnetic storms and touch base on our University’s research approach.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Associate%%%aravishankar.jpg%%%-%%%anitha.ravishanka1[at]ucalgary.ca%%%aravishankar.mp4

20211124%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Prof Will Percival%%%University of Waterloo%%%Matching Bayesian and frequentist coverage probabilities when using an approximate data covariance matrix (arXiv:2108.10402)%%%Observational astrophysics consists of making inferences about the Universe by comparing data and models. The credible intervals placed on model parameters are often as important as the maximum a posteriori probability values, as the intervals indicate concordance or discordance between models and with measurements from other data. Intermediate statistics (e.g. the power spectrum) are usually measured and inferences made by fitting models to these rather than the raw data, assuming that the likelihood for these statistics has multivariate Gaussian form. The covariance matrix used to calculate the likelihood is often estimated from simulations, such that it is itself a random variable. This is a standard problem in Bayesian statistics, which requires a prior to be placed on the true model parameters and covariance matrix, influencing the joint posterior distribution. I will review this problem and suggest a new approach linking frequentist and Bayesian approaches that have previously appeared in the astronomical literature.%%%-%%%Director of Waterloo Centre for Astrophysics%%%wpercival.png%%%-%%%will.percival[at]uwaterloo.ca%%%wpercival.mp4

20211117%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Brenna Mockler%%%University of California, Santa Cruz%%%Exploring galactic nuclei with tidal disruption events%%%Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide an exciting opportunity to study supermassive black holes in quiescent galaxies and the stellar populations and dynamics in galactic nuclei. They regularly produce super-Eddington mass fallback rates, and their light curves encode information about the accretion processes and the masses of the star and black hole. I developed a widely used tool for measuring black hole masses with TDE light curves, however, degeneracies between the accretion efficiency and the mass of the disrupted star make it difficult to measure these parameters from the light curve alone. I will show how we can combine information from the TDE light curve with constraints from the spectra and host galaxy to learn about the properties of stars in galactic nuclei.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%bmockler.png%%%-%%%bmockler[at]ucsc.edu%%%bmockler.mp4

20211110%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Sree Oh%%%ANU%%%Kinematics of galaxy bulges, disks, and gas from SAMI 3D spectroscopy%%%We investigate the stellar kinematics of the bulge and disk components and ionised gas using SAMI 3D spectroscopy data. The spatially resolved rotation velocity (V) and velocity dispersion (σ) of bulge and disk components have been simultaneously estimated using the penalised pixel fitting (PPXF) method with photometrically defined weights for the two components. The two components show mass-rotation and mass-dispersion relations with similar slopes, but different intercepts suggesting that the galaxy stellar mass scales with both V and σ for both bulge and disk components of all galaxy types. Our findings suggest that the relative contributions of the two components explain, at least to first order, the complex kinematic behaviour of galaxies. Looking further ahead, we compare gas and stellar kinematics in various galaxy types (e.g. star-forming galaxies, AGNs), finding that the difference between stellar and gas velocity dispersions correlates with the contribution of AGN to the ionised gas emission. We also discuss gas and stellar velocity dispersions as proxies for the dynamical masses.%%%-%%%ASTRO3D Postdoctoral Fellow%%%soh.jpg%%%-%%%sree.oh[at]anu.edu.au%%%soh.mp4

20211103%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Associate Professor Stas Shabala%%%University of Tasmania%%%Feedback and synchrotron emission from AGN jets%%%Relativistic jets associated with supermassive black holes are remarkable beasts. They are the most luminous objects in the radio sky; they accelerate particles to the highest energies known; and - by transferring some fraction of their enormous kinetic energy to the surrounding gas (so-called “AGN feedback”) - they regulate the evolution of the most massive galaxies over at least the last seven billion years.\nSensitive, high-resolution radio continuum observations with Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinders are uncovering details of the complex interaction between kpc-scale AGN jets and their environments. I will present theoretical work on modelling the dynamics and synchrotron emission of these interactions, using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques. In this approach, the jet dynamics is described by 3D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, while synchrotron emissivity is calculated in post-processing using an analytical model which fully accounts for the relevant loss processes. I will present some examples of insights into mechanisms responsible for jet production and AGN feedback, gained through combining such models with multi-wavelength observations.%%%-%%%-%%%sshabala.jpg%%%-%%%stanislav.shabala[at]utas.edu.au%%%sshabala.mp4

20211027%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Amit Seta%%%ANU%%%Magnetic fields in the Milky Way from pulsar observations%%%Magnetic fields are a dynamically important component of the interstellar medium of the Milky Way. Pulsars can act as an excellent probe of the Milky Way magnetic field. The average strength of the Galactic magnetic field component parallel to the line of sight can be estimated as 1.232 RM / DM, where RM and DM are the observed rotation and dispersion measure of the pulsar. However, this assumes that the thermal electron density and magnetic field of the interstellar medium are uncorrelated. Using numerical simulations and observations, we test the validity of this assumption. Based on magnetohydrodynamical simulations of driven turbulence, we show that the correlation between the thermal electron density and the small-scale magnetic field increases with increasing Mach number of the turbulence. We find that the assumption of uncorrelated thermal electron density and magnetic fields is valid only for subsonic and transsonic flows, but for supersonic turbulence, the field strength can be severely overestimated by using 1.232 RM / DM.  We then correlate existing pulsar observations from the Australia Telescope National Facility with regions of enhanced thermal electron density and magnetic fields probed by CO data of molecular clouds, magnetic fields from the Zeeman splitting of the 21 cm line, neutral hydrogen column density, and Halpha observations. Using these observational data, we show that the thermal electron density and magnetic fields are largely uncorrelated over kpc scales. Thus, we conclude that the relation 1.232 RM / DM provides a good estimate of the magnetic field on Galactic scales, but might break down on sub-kpc scales.%%%-%%%Postdoc%%%aseta.jpg%%%-%%%amit.seta[at]anu.edu.au%%%aseta.mp4

20211020%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Kaley Brauer%%%MIT%%%Studying the Tiniest, Oldest Galaxies in the Milky Way's Assembly History through Chemical Tagging and Kinematics%%%The motions and chemical composition of the stars currently present in the extended outskirts (the stellar halo) of a galaxy preserve a record of the galaxy’s formation history. While most of the stars in the center and disk of a galaxy formed in situ, many of the stars in the stellar halo originated in the many small galaxies that the central host galaxy accreted over billions of years. Currently, though, we lack ways to identify which halo stars originated in which dwarf galaxies or even reliably identify which stars were accreted. By utilizing the Caterpillar simulation suite, a suite of 32 Milky Way-mass galaxies forming, we find that stars with strong enrichment of r-process elements may have preferentially formed in the smallest dwarf galaxies that merged into the Milky Way. We also quantify how well astronomers can kinematically identify stars that accreted together from these tiny dwarf galaxies. Looking forward, we will expand on this work with several more detailed simulations of dwarf galaxy formation and of r-process material mixing into interstellar gas.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%kbrauer.png%%%-%%%kbrauer[at]mit.edu%%%kbrauer.mp4

A powerful technique for tracing the growth of structure is to use the peculiar velocities of galaxies, and their correlations.  Peculiar velocities describe the velocity of a galaxy relative to the background expansion of the Universe, imposed by the gravitational influence of the local environment.  In this talk I will present new tests using cosmological simulations to show how combining information from the local peculiar velocity field and galaxy density field provide the tightest constraints on the growth rate.  I will demonstrate how velocity and galaxy survey information can be optimally combined in a correlation function approach, discuss how these tests can be applied to existing datasets, and show how future peculiar velocity surveys will provide competitive tests of gravitational growth.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%rjturner.png%%%-%%%rjturner[at]swin.edu.au%%%rturner.mp4

Not only have they dramatically increased the rate of transient discoveries, they have allowed us to unearth new, previously unheard of, transient classes. The wide variety of different survey strategies available play a pivotal role in how we can probe the physics behind these new and exotic transients. In this talk I will demonstrate how two different surveys have done this. The Dark Energy Survey (DES), using deep multi-band imaging, has significantly broadened the definition, and understanding of Superluminous Supernovae (SLSNe), unveiling the nature of of pre-peak bumps, while the high cadence, Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), designed to probe the earliest transient epochs, has uncovered a rapidly evolving tidal disruption event uniquely hosted by an intermediate mass black hole. These two complementary approaches allow distinct insights into the nature of some of the most extreme physical processes in the Universe, and help us to prepare for future surveys, such as LSST.%%%-%%%DARK Fellow%%%cangus.jpeg%%%-%%%angus[at]nbi.ku.dk%%%cangus.mp4

20210908%%%10:00 a.m.%%%Zoom%%%Grace Olivier%%%Ohio State University%%%Evolution of Stellar Feedback from Reionization to The Milky Way: A Diverse Toolset of Imaging, Spectroscopy, and Modelling for Understanding the Impact of Massive Stars%%%Massive stars contribute incredible amounts of energy to their surroundings across a variety of environments in the universe.  Before their exciting deaths, massive stars produce feedback through a number of mechanisms that are frequently used in subgrid physics models in galaxy simulations to create realistic galaxies. Observations are a key to anchoring these simulations in reality, but there has been limited work on this front, especially for the youngest, embedded HII regions. I explore the effects of direct radiation pressure, dust-processed radiation pressure, photoionization heating and shock-heating from stellar winds in a sample of young HII regions (sources with radii < 0.5 pc) and determine which is the most important for very young stars. This analysis suggests radiative feedback on dust drives the earliest stages of HII region expansion. Additionally, I study the effects of radiative feedback in an exciting population of extremely low-metallicity star-forming galaxies that have been discovered in the local universe which are analogues to Reionization Era galaxies. During the Epoch of Reionization radiative feedback played a significant role in shaping the universe, and such analogues give us a detailed laboratory to explore the effects from feedback. I present deep FUV and optical spectra of two of these extreme emission line galaxies that have strong very-high-ionization optical and FUV emission lines (e.g., CIV, HeII, [FeV], [ArIV]).  I demonstrate that canonical photoionization models, using typical stellar population models, catastrophically fail to reproduce the high-ionization emission lines. I constrain the stellar population properties using the FUV spectral features and explore the deficiencies of current stellar models. By simultaneously fitting the stellar and nebular emission within these extremely high-ionization emission line galaxies, I provide new observational benchmarks of radiative feedback for the next generation of stellar models at very low metallicity. By studying the effects of stellar feedback from single stars in the Milky Way to entire stellar populations in analogues to the first galaxies we can begin to build a coherent picture of stellar feedback as it impacts the vast scales of the universe.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%golivier.png%%%-%%%olivier.15[at]buckeyemail.osu.edu%%%golivier.pdf

Thus, the Lyα line strength of high-z galaxies is considered a promising probe of reionization history. In order to quantitatively understand which properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) determine the transmission of Lya photons, we calculate the transmissivity from the simulated IGM of the Cosmic Dawn II (CoDa II) simulation and analyze the results. We find that the gravitational infall motion around the galaxy, size of the HII region, and self-shielded neutral gas systems are crucial factors. In this talk, I will elaborate on how those factors affect the observability of high redshift Lyα emitters.%%%-%%%-%%%hpark.png%%%-%%%hcosmosb[at]g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp%%%hpark.mp4

20210811%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Janakee Raste%%%Tata Institue of Fundamental Research%%%Implications of the z ~ 5 Lyman-α forest for oberserving the EoR 21-cm power spectrum%%%Most ongoing experiments targetting the fluctuating 21-cm cosmological signal aim to look for the signal at redshifts well above 6. This strategy is motivated by the traditional assumption that reionization ends at z >~ 6. However, recent constraints from Lyman-α and CMB data prefer a significantly delayed reionization scenario in which reionization is 50% complete at redshifts as low as z ~ 7. In these models, reionization ends at z ~ 5, with large 100 Mpc "islands" of cold, neutral hydrogen persisting in the IGM well below z = 6. We have studied the effect of these neutral hydrogen islands on the 21-cm power spectrum by analysing outputs of a state-of-the-art radiative transfer simulation of the IGM calibrated to the CMB and Lyman-α forest data. We calculate the power spectra of the 21-cm signal from this simulations and compare them with a more traditional reionization model in which reionization is completed by z = 6. Contrary to previous models, we find that thanks to the late end of reionization the 21-cm power continues at be high (~ 1 mK^2) at k ~ 0.1 h/cMpc at z = 5-6. At z = 5.5, for example, the power spectrum can be two or more orders of magnitude higher than the traditional models. This enhanced 21-cm power spectrum signal should be easily detectable by HERA and SKA1-LOW for reasonable integration times, assuming optimistic foreground subtraction. We argue that the redshift range z = 5-6 is very attractive for 21-cm experiments due to easier thermal noise characteristics and synergies with abundant multi-wavelength observations. %%%-%%%Postdoc%%%jraste.png%%%-%%%janakee[at]theory.tifr.res.in%%%jraste.mp4

Detailed measurements are now required to better constrain feedback models and to establish how outflows influence the properties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. In this talk, I will highlight recent spatially resolved studies of outflows at z~2, focusing on the launch mechanisms of star-formation-driven outflows and the variety of ways in which outflows couple AGN accretion energy to gas on nuclear, galactic and circumgalactic scales. At the end, I will discuss ongoing efforts to make robust measurements of the abundances of metal ions in the circumgalactic medium at z>5.5, with the goal of understanding the mechanisms governing the production and transport of metals in the early Universe.%%%-%%%ASTRO 3D Postdoctoral Research Associate%%%rdavies.png%%%-%%%rdavies[at]swinburne.edu.au%%%rdavies.pdf

However, the existing policies for rewards and recognition within academia are insufficient to hire, promote and retain these skilled RSEs. Broad community consultations are underway to finalise recommendations for a more sustainable research software ecosystem. These recommendations include both a top-down approach through funding, policy and research assessment and a bottom-up approach through actions of individual research groups and institutions. Both of these approaches are necessary to drive change in culture around research software. I will discuss the current developments surrounding research software, both nationally and in the international context.

We have obtained deep KMOS/MOSFIRE spectroscopic and nearly 40-band photometric data for these targets. I will present a preliminary analysis where we find early evidence of outflows in galaxies with [OIII] EWs > 1000A. I will argue that the EoR analogs is a unique sample to constrain the production efficiency of the ionizing photons and their escape fraction in z>6 galaxies.

20210630%%%12:00 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 2, Hercus Theatre (+Zoom)%%%Adam Batten%%%Swinburne University%%%Probing the Intergalactic Medium with Fast Radio Bursts and Hydrodynamic Simulations%%%The Intergalactic Medium (IGM) is a difficult observe in the optical and UV due to the high temperatures (T ~ 10^6K) and low densities (n ~ 10^-6 cm^-3) leading to a lack of favourable transition lines. The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a unique new way to probe the ionized baryons in the IGM. Cosmological models with different parameters lead to different DM-redshift (DM−z) relations. Additionally, the over/under-dense regions in the IGM and intervening galaxies' circumgalactic medium lead to scattering around the mean DM−z relations. I will present the recent work I have done using the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations to study the DM-z relation, and the scatter around it. I find that almost all of the FRBs found at low-redshifts have significantly larger observed DMs than predicted from simulations. I will also show that we would need of the order 9000 localised FRBs to constrain AGN feedback efficiency. Finally I will talk about a future project measuring the metallicity of the IGM in EAGLE and the sizes of ‘metal bubbles’ around galaxies at the end of the epoch of reionisation. %%%-%%%PhD Student%%%abatten.jpg%%%-%%%abatten[at]swin.edu.au%%%abatten.mp4

20210623%%%04:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Laura Sommovigo%%%Scuola Normale Superiore%%%Feverish dust at the Epoch of Reionization? Taking the temperature and studying the implications%%%ALMA observations have revealed the presence of dust in the first generations of galaxies in the Universe. However, the dust temperature Td remains mostly unconstrained due to the few available FIR continuum data. This introduces large uncertainties in the derived dust masses, infrared luminosities, and obscured fraction of star formation of high-z (z>5) galaxies. We have developed a new analytical method that allows us to constrain Td using a single continuum data point at 158 microns by combining it with the overlying CII emission. With our method, one can analyse uniquely CII and continuum detections, and the targets of ALMA large programs such as ALPINE and REBELS. In particular, REBELS is providing us with unprecedented numerous continuum detections at z>7, increasing of a factor ~6 the available data so far. Our analysis of these sources will shed light on the evolution of the dust temperature and dependent quantities with redshift, glimpsing the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) for the first time. Preliminary results indicate that the dust temperature increases at a higher redshift, with a larger scatter w.r.t. to that observed in the local universe. We physically motivate the increasing Td-redshift trend as a consequence of the decreasing total gas depletion time induced by a more vigorous cosmological accretion at early times. A higher Td has testable implications: (a) it reduces the tension between local and high-z IRX-β relation, (b) it alleviates the problem of the uncomfortably large dust masses deduced from observations of some EoR galaxies, (c) it results in a larger obscured fraction of the SFR. This is consistent with the flattening of the cosmic Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) at z>4 suggested by recent observations at FIR and radio wavelengths of dusty UV-obscured systems.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%lsommovigo.jpeg%%%-%%%laura.sommovigo[at]sns.it%%%lsommovigo.mp4

I will present the first southern hemisphere all-sky real-time imaging and radio-transient monitoring system, implemented on two prototype stations of the low frequency (50 - 350 MHz) component of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low), the Engineering Development Array 2 (EDA2) and Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2). For the last two years these prototypes have been regularly collecting data to verify their performance against the SKA-Low specifications and simulations, including making all-sky images every two seconds used for transient searches. The transient identification algorithm used 2-second difference images to find candidates and required their detection in the images from both stations. In approximately 360 hours of data using a single coarse channel (0.926 MHz bandwidth), we identified a few episodes of extremely bright pulses from the pulsar PSR B0950+08 and several transients from an unknown object, which is currently under investigation. We also determined preliminary upper limits on surface density of radio transients at a 2-second timescale. We plan to increase the bandwidth by at least 40 times (to about 40 MHz) and time resolution to 10 ms or better in order to improve the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude and start detecting hundreds of FRBs per year. This upgrade will transform the stations into low-frequency FRB survey machines looking for FRBs and signals from extraterrestrial intelligence in high-time resolution all-sky images, which will pave the way to similar searches with hundreds of SKA-Low stations.%%%-%%%Associate Professor%%%rwayth.png%%%-%%%R.Wayth[at]curtin.edu.au%%%rwayth.mp4

WooClap allows meeting attendees to participate with presenters in real-time throughout the session – <b>they only need to have a personal device with internet capability on hand to do so</b> (a mobile phone, tablet/ipad or laptop). At the start of the zoom meeting, we will provide everyone in the session with a URL to gain access to WooClap. Attendees need simply to enter this URL into their personal device (or they can take an image of the QR code provided on the main screen with their phones) to participate via a series of questions posed by the presenters throughout the session. As attendees respond to these prompts, real-time results from their answers will appear on the main presentation screen which the presenters can then react to. </p><p>Feedback from participant responses is captured for review at a later stage, which helps us to gain a better understanding of the individual needs of our members.

Since the historic discovery of GW150914 five years ago, LIGO and Virgo detectors have discovered 50 compact binary merger events. These merger events, lasting from fractions of seconds to minutes, include stellar-mass binary black holes, binary neutron stars and likely neutron star-black hole binaries. Meanwhile, pulsar timing arrays have been used to search for gravitational waves with periods of years to decades. After several decades of international efforts, it is believed that we are approaching the sensitivity to detect waves from supermassive binary black holes. In this talk, I will summarize recent progresses and future prospects of gravitational wave astronomy on both short and long timescales, with a focus on the study of binary neutron stars and recent results from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array.%%%-%%%Reaserch Fellow%%%xzhu.jpg%%%-%%%zhuxj[at]bnu.edu.cn%%%zhuxj.zip

Since then, millions of galaxies have been discovered, yet one relatively simple question remains open: what are the true three dimensional shapes of galaxies? The intangible nature of observational astronomy means that any one galaxy provides a single, two dimensional perspective, and it is this aspect of our field that makes this question so difficult to answer. In this talk, I will give an overview of the history of galaxy 3D shape research from statistical photometric studies up to more recent advances incorporating galaxy kinematics with integral field spectroscopy. I will then present critical tests we have performed of these recent methods that incorporate mock IFS from cosmological hydrodynamics simulations (from which the true 3D shapes are known). These tests have revealed striking biases in the recovered shapes of galaxies that have spurred us in a new direction: machine learning and neural networks. I will finish with our preliminary results in galaxy shape prediction with these modern techniques, which may provide an important step forward in this fundamental area of research.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%rbassett.jpg%%%-%%%rbassett[at]swin.edu.au%%%rbassett.mp4

These massive quiescent galaxies (MQG) have proven difficult to reproduce in sufficient numbers in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. While the latest generation of simulations have begun to achieve more consistent number densities through detailed prescriptions of AGN feedback, the observed quenched galaxies still appear to quench at earlier epochs. This begs the question: how early in the Universe can we still find quiescent galaxies? Additionally, high redshift MQGs host old stellar populations that can provide insights into the star-formation conditions during the epoch of reionisation. The intense star-bursts that likely formed MQGs are expected to have a different distribution of stellar masses, the initial-mass function (IMF), compared to local elliptical galaxies. I present work done to identify these rare MQGs at high redshift based on the FENIKS survey and determine some of their physical properties using a combination of deep HST imaging and MOSFIRE spectra.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%jesdaile.png%%%-%%%jesdaile[at]swin.edu.au%%%jesdaile.key

New low-frequency radio telescopes able to probe the neutral hydrogen in the high-redshift Universe (z~6-30) come in two flavours: single-antennas that probe the average thermal history of the Universe (such as EDGES, SARAS and REACH), and interferometers that measure the spatial fluctuations of 21cm emission (such as HERA, MWA and SKA). </p><p> Both come with an extraordinary challenge: bright foregrounds amplify small spectral "features" in the instrument, obscuring the background signal unless calibrated to one part in 10^5. Accounting for these effects is susceptible to inadvertant removal of part of the signal, which has led to several retractions of published upper-limits over the past decade. Add to this the extremely surprising results from EDGES in 2018, and we must ask: how much can we trust the results of 21cm experiments, and how can we build confidence amongst the community? </p><p> In this talk, I will discuss my role in answering these questions with two current 21cm experiments -- EDGES and HERA. </p><p> EDGES is working to verify its result from 2018 using new and improved data and improved analysis techniques. I will describe our new effort to forward-model systematics, starting with receiver calibration and simple models for the antenna reflection coefficients, showing the effects of propagating their full correlated uncertainties on the cosmological estimates. </p><p> Concerning HERA, I will report on the work of the Validation team (Aguirre et al., 2021), in support of our recent first upper limit (Kern et al., 2021).

This simulation was processed with the exact analysis pipeline used for the data.

Nielsen%%%Swinburne University%%%The Circumgalactic Medium at Cosmic Noon with KCWI%%%The star formation history of the universe reveals that galaxies most actively build their stellar mass at "cosmic noon" (z=1-3). The gas accreting onto galaxies to drive their construction and the resulting metal-enriched material ejected from these galaxies due to feedback must pass through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The CGM is a massive reservoir of diffuse, multiphase gas out to ~200 kpc and is the interface between the intergalactic medium and the galaxy. While the CGM is well-studied at z<1, little attention has been paid to the reservoir when star formation is most active, due to the difficulty in identifying host galaxies at cosmic noon. The installation of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI), a sensitive integral field spectrograph, on Keck II has opened a new window to quickly identify galaxies via their Lyman alpha emission at cosmic noon as well as to directly image the CGM in emission. I will introduce two new surveys with KCWI aiming to study the CGM in (1) absorption around galaxies at z=2-3 and (2) emission around local starbursting galaxies (cosmic noon analogues). These surveys are still in progress, but first results reveal strong outflows at cosmic noon and tantalising sub-kiloparsec structure in the CGM.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Research Associate%%%nnielsen.jpg%%%cgm.jpg%%%nikolenielsen[at]swin.edu.au%%%nnielsen.mp4

Despite their frequency and high energy output, what causes these bursts have eluded astronomers since their discovery over a decade ago. FRBs may result from magnetar bursts, binary neutron star mergers (producing kilonovae), neutron stars collapsing to black holes (blitzars) or several other theories.  Information on emission coherent with the radio burst in other wavelengths can help reveal the physical processes that create these bursts.  I present results from an observational program that can do this called the Deeper Faster Wider (DWF) program. A key part of the DWF program is coordinating ~10 multi-wavelength observatories to perform deep, wide-field, fast cadence observations on the same field simultaneously to collect possible imaging on fast-evolving transients before they fade. Importantly, DWF can collect data before, during and after fast transients. Typically, a DWF observing run goes for a week.  In particular, I present results from DWF operation run 8 (DWF-O8). During DWF-O8, two FRBs were detected with the Murriyang Radio Telescope (formerly known as the Parkes Radio Telescope). Simultaneously observing with Murriayng was the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory , Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope, AstroSat, the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the Huntsman Telescope, Murriyang and the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope, amongst others. %%%-%%%Postdoctoral Researcher%%%jzhang.png%%%-%%%jielaizhang[at]swin.edu.au%%%jzhang.mp4

Most studies use injection-recovery simulations to determine completeness functions. Although conceptually the same, these simulations have subtle but important differences in their definition of the completeness function across existing studies. In turn, this requires implementation of different methods to obtain the final determination of the UVLFs. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of existing methods using a reference set of mock observations, and then compare the methods when applied to the same set of Hubble Legacy Field (HLF) images. We find that some methods may suffer limitations in a presence of substantial photometric scatter and/or steep luminosity functions.%%%-%%%-%%%nleethochawalit.png%%%-%%%nicha.leethochawalit@unimelb.edu.au%%%-

A letter he wrote on 21 December 1613 to a former student in Prague sets out his forthright views on the relationship between religious doctrine and science.  Galileo's letter found its way into the hands of the Inquisition in Rome and this ultimately led to Galileo's conviction of "vehement suspicion of heresy".  Galileo must have realised his letter would cause trouble because he claimed the letter passed to the authorities in Rome had been altered by malevolent forces out to damage him and strengthen their case for heresy.  He released a new version of the letter with much less inflammatory language which he claimed was the original.  In a sensational discovery in the library of the Royal Society in London UK, Galileo's claim of alteration is shown to be false.  Incorrectly filed for 250 years, the original of the inflammatory letter was accidentally rediscovered in 2018, with edits in Galileo's own handwriting to tone down the language.  This is a remarkable piece of history about a physicist facing dire consequences at the hands of the authorities.  A particular passage in the letter has captured my attention.  Galileo wrote "This (scientific knowledge) applies especially to those sciences about which one can read only very small phrases and scattered conclusions in the Scripture as is particularly the case for astronomy, of which it contains such a small portion that one does not even find in it the names of all the planets."  I will link this statement back to Galileo's observations of the planet Neptune that occurred in December 1612 to January 1613 just on one year before he wrote his inflammatory letter.  We may be able to glean new insights into his thinking at the time.%%%-%%%-%%%djamieson.png%%%-%%%d.jamieson@unimelb.edu.au%%%-

I will discuss a toy model of quenching which successfully reproduces a number of important differences between quiescent and star-forming galaxies at redshift 0, including their different mass-metallicity relations and mass-size planes. This model was born out of my studies of stellar metallicities in the SAMI galaxy survey, and I will also give a brief summary of my metallicity measurements and some of the powerful statistical tools I've used in my analysis. %%%-%%%-%%%svaughan.png%%%-%%%sam.vaughan@sydney.edu.au%%%svaughan.pdf

Examples of the former include the discovery of T and Y-class brown dwarfs from surveys like 2MASS or WISE, or higher and higher redshift QSOs from larger and larger surveys. </p><p> Opening new phase space through higher measurement precision has been particularly prominent lately - exoplanets being first discovered by increasing precise Doppler measurements, more exoplanets being discovered by increasing precise photometry from space, or gravitation waves being confirmed by increasingly precise strain meters. </p><p> The Veloce instrument on the AAT seeks to push the boundaries of increasingly precise Doppler velocity measurement at a fraction of the cost of competing instruments.

We generally interpret this mass dependence as a signature of stellar feedback despite the fact that stellar feedback models also predict time evolution in the star formation efficiency. In this talk, I'll focus on this apparent tension, and show that to remain in agreement with observations, competing feedback scenarios require qualitatively different assumptions about the properties of dust and the duty cycle of star formation in galaxies. As a result, I'll discuss the prospects for distinguishing models based on the 'dustiness' and 'burstiness' of galaxies found in upcoming galaxy surveys with JWST and ALMA, and potentially via constraints on reionization from future 21-cm experiments.%%%-%%%-%%%jmirocha.png%%%-%%%jordan.mirocha@mcgill.ca%%%-

While the use of fitting formulae to stellar tracks remains a popular choice for modelling stellar evolution in population synthesis codes, they are not adaptable to changes in the stellar tracks. In this talk, I will present results from an alternative approach, METISSE, which uses interpolation between sets of pre-computed stellar tracks to approximate evolution parameters for a population of stars. It can readily make use of stellar models computed with different stellar evolution codes and can compare their predictions for populations of stars. Using METISSE with the data from two different stellar evolution codes, I will show how different physical ingredients used in the evolution of massive stars, such as the treatment of their radiation dominated envelopes, can lead to differences in their evolutionary properties. These differences are important as they can help us account for observations of the stellar populations and the formation of gravitational wave progenitors.%%%-%%%-%%%pagrawal.png%%%-%%%pagrawal@swin.edu.au%%%pagrawal.pdf

Whereas these models are practically indistinguishable with respect to the predicted characteristics of high-mass substructure, the critical difference lies in the abundance and statistical properties of low-mass galactic substructure. Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing provides a unique opportunity to search for gravitational signatures of such low-mass substructure in lens galaxies beyond the Local Group. In this talk, I will present a novel approach to observationally constrain the statistical nature of low-mass sub-galactic structure in the inner regions of massive elliptical lens galaxies, based on the power spectrum of surface-brightness anomalies measured in highly-magnified galaxy-scale Einstein rings and gravitational arcs. A future comparison of these results with the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations might either verify the CDM paradigm or require its substantial revision.%%%-%%%-%%%dbayer.png%%%-%%%dbayer@swin.edu.au%%%dbayer.pdf

What cosmological simulations can (and cannot) tell us about the cold phase of the CGM%%%Simulations are now allowing us to probe the scales of the CGM (circumgalactic medium) around galaxies in order to look at the influence of realistic galaxy formation processes. However, it is apparent that the properties of the multi-phase CGM are not yet converged in simulations (e.g. Van de Voort et al., 2019; Hummels et al., 2019), hence their reliability to make predictions is still in question. It is also clear the CGM plays a key role in the evolution of a galaxy; it is a supply of gas for star formation and a key site for feedback-generated outflows, along with the recycling of baryons (for a recent review see Tumlinson et al., 2017). </p><p> During this talk I will discuss the results of my recent paper (Garratt-Smithson et al. 2020 - available on astro-ph) and in particular the significant mass of HI seen in the CGM of EAGLE galaxies between redshift 2 and 0. I will explore the physical conditions of this HI, and discuss whether or not we can constrain the fraction existing in the cold neutral medium. I will also discuss the physical processes we can constrain by studying the detailed properties of this CGM HI gas; in particular I link my results back to AGN and stellar feedback, along with how this is modelled in simulations.

I will present the results of analysing 21 weakly lensed systems and present ways to overcome weak lensing limitations and be sensitive to the dispersion in halo masses.%%%-%%%-%%%pperez.png%%%-%%%pgurriperez@swin.edu.au%%%pperez.pdf

20200909%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom colloquium%%%Dr Rob Bassett%%%Swinburne University%%%IGM Attenuation Bias for Lyman Continuum Detected Galaxies at z > 3.0%%%Understanding the sources responsible for driving reionization has been a major goal in astrophysics for many years. One critical measurement required is the ionizing (or Lyman continuum, LyC) escape fraction from observed galaxy samples. A major difficulty arises from the level of transmission of LyC through the intergalactic medium (IGM), an unknown (but essential) quantity in the calculation of LyC escape from individual sources. The typical method is to assume an average transmission value based on consideration of HI column density distribution functions, but is this appropriate? In general, observational surveys at high redshift are strongly biased towards the brightest objects as these are the easiest to detect. Given the fact that LyC emission is remarkably faint, we should expect to only detect those galaxies with the highest emergent LyC flux. This, in turn, suggests that detections of LyC in surveys will be biased towards IGM sightlines with higher than average transmission of ionizing photons. In this talk I discuss the quantification of this IGM transmission bias for LyC detections and explore the implications when considering the recovered LyC escape values from current surveys. Careful consideration of such biases will be critical in understanding how LyC escape depends on galaxy properties, which ultimately colours our understanding of how reionization proceeds.%%%-%%%-%%%rbassett.png%%%-%%%rbassett@swin.edu.au%%%rbassett.pdf

To understand the chemical history of our universe the abundances of elements heavier than iron are observed in the photospheres of old stars. The vast majority of heavy elements are formed by the slow (s) and rapid (r) neutron-capture processes. However, some observations of heavy-element abundance patterns of old stars are incompatible with either of these processes or even a combination of both. </p><p> I will show that these puzzling heavy-element patterns can be explained as the result of a separate neutron-capture process operating at neutron densities intermediate to the s and r process: the i process. Comparing theoretical predictions of i-process nucleosynthesis with the observed abundance patterns gives us new insights into uncertain phases of stellar evolution and will ultimately help us understand the origin of the elements in our universe.%%%-%%%-%%%mhampel.png%%%-%%%melanie.hampel@monash.edu%%%-

By comparing the amplitude of these different observational signatures, we can construct tests that can distinguish General Relativity from its potential modifications.  We use the latest weak gravitational lensing dataset from the Kilo-Degree Survey, KiDS-1000, in conjunction with overlapping galaxy redshift surveys, to perform the most accurate existing amplitude ratio test on projected scales up to 100 Mpc/h.  The scale-independence and redshift-dependence of these measurements are consistent with the theoretical expectation of General Relativity in a Universe with matter density Omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.04.  We demonstrate that our results are robust against different analysis choices, including schemes for correcting the effects of source photometric redshift errors.%%%-%%%-%%%cblake.png%%%-%%%cblake@swin.edu.au%%%-

However, due to their long lifetimes and close proximity, supernova remnants which are the long lived structures that results from the supernova explosion of either a white dwarf or a massive star, provide us with a unique opportunity to study supernova explosion and dynamics up close and in detail.

New stars that are created from this gas contain the elements that were produced from the previous generations of stars. From the spatial distribution of elements, it is therefore possible to constrain the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the galaxies. This approach, Galactic Archaeology, has been popularly used for our Milky Way Galaxy. It can also be applied to external galaxies thanks to the recent and future observations with integral field units (extra-galactic archaeology). My team has been running hydrodynamical simulations from cosmological initial conditions including detailed chemical enrichment.

We compare the observed population of BeXBs in the Small Magellanic Cloud to simulated populations of BeXB-like systems produced with the COMPAS population synthesis code. We focus on the apparently higher minimal mass of Be stars in BeXBs than in the Be population at large. Assuming that BeXBs experienced only dynamical stable mass transfer, their mass distribution suggests that the efficiency of accretion rarely drops below ~30%. We also investigate the observed orbital period distribution and number of observed systems, looking for further constraints on our mass transfer models. Finally, we argue if ultra stripped stars could lead to fast rotating neutron stars in BeXBs.

Ideally such a model would incorporate star formation, stellar feedback, gravitational instability, the maintenance of turbulence, and transport of gas through the ISM into a unified framework, simultaneously explaining the relation between gas content and star formation (the Kennicutt relation), the observed correlation between galaxies' star formation rates and velocity dispersions, and a variety of other observations. I summarise the various ways that theorists have attempted to fit together physical ingredients to reach this goal, the differing physical pictures behind these models, and the strengths and weaknesses of each when it comes to reproducing the observations. I then show that it is possible to combine the best elements of these models into a single, unified picture that successfully reproduces most of the major observations. I suggest future observations and numerical experiments that can be used to test this unified model.%%%-%%%-%%%mkrumholz.png%%%-%%%mark.krumholz[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

The relevant wavelengths for observation are concurrent with those allocated for common radio broadcasts such as FM radio and digital television. Consequently, these transmissions can interfere with radio observations, and are thus dubbed radio frequency interference (RFI). The ever-looming threat of radio frequency interference demands that radio telescopes be placed in extremely remote locations. Even still, extremely remote telescopes such as the Murchison Widefield Array observe interference at non-negligible levels. In this talk, we introduce a new RFI mitigation strategy, known as Sky-Subtracted Incoherent Noise Spectra (SSINS), which was designed to detect extremely faint RFI. We show that the increased RFI mitigation afforded by SSINS makes a noticeable difference in redshifted 21cm power spectrum estimations. Furthermore, through analytic calculations and simulations, we characterize the expected effect of RFI on 21cm power spectra. Ultimately we conclude that RFI poses a serious threat to reionization science, and that pristine site conditions will be essential to making a detection of Hydrogen reionization.%%%-%%%-%%%no_image.png%%%-%%%mjw768[at]uw.edu%%%-

These objects are nearing the main sequence and so have cleared their inner discs and stopped accreting, but are still contracting and have an evolving internal structure. Examining the large-scale surface brightness and magnetic field maps for a small sample of weak-line T Tauri stars, we find that stars with similar brightness maps can have different magnetic field topologies. The magnetic map results more generally suggest some differences in the large-scale dynamo fields of weak-line T Tauri stars compared with classical T Tauri stars and main sequence stars of a corresponding spectral type. </p><p> In addition to studying weak-line T Tauri star magnetic activity, Doppler Imaging allows us to hunt for orbiting close-in giant planets.

Understanding the nature of the ionizing sources, the associated ionization of the IGM, and its impact on subsequent structure formation and galaxy evolution by means of radiative feedback effects, represent key outstanding questions in current astrophysics. </p><p> In the past few years high-redshift galaxy observations and simulations have significantly extended our knowledge on the nature of high-redshift galaxies. However, essential properties such as the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies into the intergalactic medium and their dependency on galactic properties remain essentially unknown, but determine significantly the distribution and time evolution of the ionized regions during reionization. Analysing this ionization topology by means of the neutral hydrogen sensitive 21cm signal with radio interferometers such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) offers a complementary and unique opportunity to determine the nature of these first galaxies and pin down the reionization history. </p><p> In this talk, I will discuss how synergising high-redshift galaxy observations with 21cm signal detections can provide constraints on reionization. Furthermore, I will show results from a self-consistent semi-numerical model of galaxy evolution and reionization, and discuss the potential of inferring galactic properties, as the escape fraction of ionizing photons, with the 21cm signal by means of its bispectrum.%%%-%%%-%%%ahutter.png%%%-%%%a.k.hutter[at]rug.nl%%%ahutter.pdf

20190722%%%14:15 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 6 Geoff Opat seminar room%%%Akanksha Kapahtia%%%Indian Institute of Astrophysics%%%Morphology of cosmological fields during the epoch of Reionization%%%Neutral hydrogen is the dominant component of the universe after recombination with high density regions harbouring the first luminous objects. The radiation from these first luminous objects changes the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium leading to a major transition in the history of the universe called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The EoR is marked by the appearance of ionized regions around these collapsed objects which grow and merge until the entire universe is ionized. The growth and topology of these ionized regions depends upon the properties of these first luminous sources. One important observational probe of the EoR is the 21cm spin flip hyperfine transition of the neutral hydrogen.  The brightness temperature of this transition encodes the ionization and heating history of the IGM. We introduce real space morphological descriptors, called Minkowski Tensors (MTs) and topological quantities Betti numbers, to probe the morphology of the 21cm brightness temperature field. The MTs provide shape and anisotropy information of the structures in the excursion set of the fields, while Betti numbers describe the topology in terms of the number of connected regions and holes.  We obtain different regimes of morphological evolution of brightness temperature, as the universe evolves depending upon different astrophysical settings of the EoR. Therefore, we show that the ionization history of the IGM can be reconstructed using the morphological description of brightness temperature in real space and help us further probe the properties of the first luminous objects.%%%-%%%-%%%akapahtia.png%%%-%%%akanksha.kapahtia[at]iiap.res.in%%%akapahtia.pdf

However, they produce reconstructed interferometric images that are limited in quality and scalability for big data. In this work, we demonstrate the use of computationally distributed state-of-the-art sparse image reconstruction algorithms which have been implemented in the PURIFY software package. We do this by applying PURIFY to real interferometric observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), where PURIFY out performs CLEAN in modelling structure shown by the residuals. Lastly, we use PURIFY in wide-field imaging at low frequencies, where the w-projection algorithm models wide-fields of view with the non-coplanar w-term.The required accuracy and computational cost of these corrections is one of the largest unsolved challenges facing next generation radio interferometers. We show that the same calculation can be performed with a radially symmetric w-projection kernel, where we use one dimensional adaptive quadrature to calculate the resulting Hankel transform, decreasing the computation required for kernel generation by several orders of magnitude, whilst preserving the accuracy. We demonstrate the potential of our radially symmetric w-projection kernel via sparse image reconstruction, using the software package PURIFY. We develop a distributed w-stacking and w-projection hybrid algorithm where we apply exact w-term corrections for each measurement from observations from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), showing that it allows full wide-field correction for real data sets.%%%-%%%-%%%lpratley.png%%%-%%%luke.pratley[at]gmail.com%%%lpratley

Initially, we recover the results shown by 21CMMC for the parameter estimation of 21cmFAST models. We proceed to test several toy models of the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) defined in contrasting morphology and scale. We find that LOFAR observations are unlikely to allow model selection even with long integration times. HERA would require 61 dipoles to perform the same analysis in 1080 hours, and becomes comparable to the SKA with 217 dipoles. We find the SKA requires only 324 hours of observation to conclusively distinguish between our models. Once model selection is achievable, an analysis of observational priors is performed finding that neutral fraction checks at specific redshifts add little to no inference. We show the difficulties in model selection at the level of distinguishing fiducial parameters within a model or distinguishing galaxies with a constant versus power law mass-to-light ratio. Finally, we explore the use of the Savage-Dickey density ratio to show the redundancy of the parameter Rmfp within 21cmFAST.%%%-%%%-%%%tbinnie.png%%%-%%%t.binnie16[at]imperial.ac.uk%%%tbinnie.pdf

In this talk, I will discuss three broadly related research topics. First, I will present a new framework that enables the inference of neutron star population properties (e.g., equation of state and magnetic field evolution) through the synergy of radio observations of Galactic double neutron stars and gravitational-wave measurements of neutron star mergers.

Hubble observations have placed a now-commonly-held view that the intrinsically faint galaxies are responsible for driving the reionization process, but with a fundamental assumption of large escape fractions >10%. A further puzzle comes from the recent deep spectroscopy of luminous galaxies and the spatial opacity fluctuation of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z>5.7, which suggests a possibly important role of luminous systems and active galactic nuclei/quasars (QSOs). In the theoretical front, simulating early galaxies and the reionization process and is extremely challenging, requiring the understanding of the physics over a huge dynamic range from the scale of molecular clouds to the intergalactic medium. To shed light on these issues, we introduce a new spectroscopic programme surveying 5<z<7 Lyman-break galaxies around the Lyman alpha forest region of a background QSO to directly examine the correlation between galaxies and the physical state of the IGM, complemented by the detailed study of lower redshift analogues of reionization-era galaxies. We also discuss the future prospect for the 3D 21cm tomography of the reionization process and what can be learnt from the direct imaging beyond power spectra. The results demonstrate the potential of future large spectroscopic galaxy survey in z>6 QSO fields and a power of direct 3D mapping of galaxies and the IGM via 21cm tomography, which will be enabled by JWST, ELT, and SKA.%%%-%%%-%%%kkakiichi.png%%%-%%%k.kakiichi[at]ucl.ac.uk%%%kkakiichi.pdf

One fundamental challenge though is accurate tracking and position prediction of objects in orbit. Beyond improving technology, the only method for tackling this challenge is in improving orbit propagation method. Orbit propagation allows a user to predict where an object will be in the future given its current position. This research focusses on improving general perturbations methods for orbit propagation. General perturbations methods for orbit propagation are typically considered to be less accurate and/or less useful than their numerical counterparts. The major problem facing these methods in terms of accuracy is that it is very difficult to capture time dependant phenomena such as the solar activity cycle's effect on atmospheric density in a general perturbation solution. To date very little research on this topic has been published, as computers became more powerful it became less important to study such methods. However, as space debris has become such a prevalent issue, threatening the safety of both current and future missions, it has once again become prudent to look at methods that can allow the propagation of a large catalogue of objects in as computationally inexpensive way as possible.%%%-%%%-%%%ekerr.png%%%-%%%emma.kerr[at]rmit.edu.au%%%-

In this talk I will present various ways in which we can use galaxy redshift surveys to test theoretical models. In particular, using observables like Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift-space distortions, we can measure the cosmological parameters as well as test models of dark energy and modified gravity. The low statistical errors on cosmological parameters promised by future galaxy surveys will only be realised with the development of new, fast, analysis methods that reduce potential systematic problems to low levels.

I will present different methods to select galaxies in transition, showing how different approaches can reveal different pathways to quenching. \n - Transition galaxies can be identified as outliers in the  SFR-mass plane. I will focus on the cluster SFR-mass relation at z=0 and show that in some galaxies the star formation is enhanced, while in some others it is suppressed with respect to the field. The triggering of the star formation is due to fast gas removal processes, such as ram pressure stripping  (Vulcani+2018c), while its suppression is due to slow processes, such as strangulation (Paccagnella, Vulcani+2016). \n - Transition galaxies can be selected according to their spectral information. I will show how the incidence and the properties of post starburst galaxies, tracers of fast quenching processes,  depend on environment (Paccagnella, Vulcani+2017, 2018). \n - Transition galaxies can be selected using photometric information. I will also present an analysis of those galaxies that show signs of an ongoing or recent transformation of their star formation activity and/or morphology discussing an evolutionary scenario that links all the different populations at z=0 (Vulcani+15). \n These analyses are based on the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE (GASP) survey, the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS), its recent extension OmegaWINGS and the Padova Millennium Galaxy Group Catalog (PM2GC). %%%-%%%-%%%bvulcani.png%%%-%%%benedetta.vulcani[at]inaf.it%%%bvulcani.pdf

20190306%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr Matthew Baring%%%Rice University%%%Magnetar Magnetospheres under the Microscope%%%Magnetars are young neutron stars with high surface magnetic fields, exceeding around 10 TeraGauss. Pulsed, non-thermal quiescent X-ray emission extending between 10 keV to >150 keV has been observed in about 10 magnetars by RXTE, INTEGRAL, Suzaku, NuSTAR and Fermi-GBM. This talk describes a model for the generation of such hard X-ray signals, wherein the emission is produced by resonant Compton upscattering of soft thermal photons from the neutron star surface. This mechanism is efficient due to the enhancement of the scattering cross section at the cyclotron resonance. Spectra that approximately match observations can be generated by emission volumes within about ten stellar radii of the magnetar surface. The observed/implied maximum energies of these hard X-ray signals may require that an attenuation process such as magnetic photon splitting be active.  This prospect can be probed by future sensitive Compton telescopes with polarimetric capability, for example the AMEGO concept. Interestingly, key pulsation and spectral signatures can be used to constrain the viewing geometry and the angle between the magnetic and spin axes of magnetars, a diagnostic that may improve the ability to precisely determine the strengths of magnetar fields.%%%-%%%-%%%mbaring.png%%%-%%%baring[at]rice.edu%%%mbaring.pdf

However, the positional uncertainties make fast localisation of the electromagnetic counterpart extremely difficult. In order to address this concern, I use new rapid-response systems on Australian radio telescopes to rapidly and automatically obtain observations of transients. These systems allow telescopes to "trigger" on transient alerts, causing the telescope to automatically repoint and begin collecting data within minutes of discovery. For example, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) can be on-target within 14 seconds of receiving a trigger. Additionally, the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) can now be on-target within minutes. My main research focus is on the rapid follow-up of transients, particularly short-duration gamma-ray bursts, a known subclass of gravitational wave events that are well localised by the Swift telescope. MWA response times are fast enough to probe for prompt radio signals predicted to be produced by merging neutron star binaries, in-turn allowing us to test neutron star merger models. ATCA can be on-target to probe the reverse shock emission from gamma-ray bursts, allowing us to determine a template of the radio luminosities and temporal behaviour of the gravitational wave events that will be detected by aLIGO/Virgo. In this talk, I will discuss some of the early results from the MWA and ATCA rapid-response observations of transient events and how these experiements will contribute invaluable knowledge towards optimising transient science to be conducted with the Square Kilometre Array.%%%-%%%-%%%ganderson.jpg%%%-%%%gemma.anderson[at]curtin.edu.au%%%ganderson.pdf

I will explain how we go from the observed signal to making inferences about the source's parameters, such as a black hole's mass and spin. These properties are an insight into the processes that forged these compact objects. With a growing catalogue of observations, we can begin to constrain the properties of the population. This can help to pin down the uncertain physics of binary evolution. Making a binary black hole involves many processes that are currently poorly understood, such as stellar mass loss rates and the kicks imparted in supernova explosions. Once we have large numbers of detections, as expected following the upcoming observing runs, we can use mass and merger rate measurements to constrain the parameters describing these processes to a few percent. Adding in further information, such as the evolution of the merger rate with redshift will provide an even more detailed picture of the physics of binary evolution.%%%-%%%-%%%cberry.png%%%-%%%christopher.berry[at]northwestern.edu%%%cberry.pdf

Because most of this material is too diffuse to form stars, its direct imaging has remained elusive for several decades leaving fundamental questions about the structure of the universe still open, including: How are galaxies linked to each other? What are the morphological and physical properties of the Cosmic Web on both large and small scales? How do galaxies accrete gas from the Cosmic Web? In this talk, I will tackle these questions using the results of a new program to directly detect and study high-redshift cosmic gas in emission using bright quasars and galaxies as external "sources of illumination". In particular, I will show results from ultra-deep narrow-band imaging and integral-field-spectroscopy with both MUSE/VLT and the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) that revealed numerous giant Lyman-alpha emitting filaments extending up to several hundred kpc around quasars and bright galaxies. I will discuss how the unexpectedly high luminosities of these systems, together with the constraints from Helium and metal extended emission, represent a challenge for our current understanding of cosmological structure formation. In particular, I will show that current observations suggest that intergalactic gas around high-redshift galaxies and quasars has a much broader density distribution of cold material than expected from cosmological simulations and I will present our first attempts to understand the origin and nature of these structures using high-resolution hydrodynamical models. At the same time, current galaxy formation models lack an efficient mechanism to prevent too much intergalactic gas cooling onto galaxies at later epochs and rely on very strong "ejective" feedback. In the final part of the talk (if time allows), I will show how the interaction between high-energy radiation from star-forming galaxies and the gas surrounding them provides a natural way to prevent "excessive" intergalactic gas cooling onto galaxies and I will discuss HST/COS observations that provide support for the importance of this effect.%%%-%%%-%%%scantalupo.png%%%-%%%cantalupo[at]phys.ethz.ch%%%-

However, it is unclear whether the declining star formation rates are simply the result of lower molecular gas masses, or whether the star formation efficiency has also evolved. In this talk I will discuss how the molecular gas contents of galaxies are measured and highlight the difficulties of doing so at high redshift.

When developing mathematical models to describe these large-scale quantum condensates, physicists tend to focus on the interface between astrophysics and nuclear physics. Connections with low-temperature physics are often ignored. However, there has been dramatic progress in understanding and experimenting with laboratory condensates (from the different phases of superfluid helium to the entire range of superconductors and ultra-cold gases). In this talk, I will provide an overview of what we know about superfluid and superconducting components in neutron stars, and suggest novel ways that we may make progress in understanding neutron star physics using the connections to terrestrial low-temperature condensates.%%%-%%%MSI Fellow%%%vgraber.jpg%%%-%%%vanessa.graber[at]mcgill.ca%%%vgraber.pdf

20181114%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 6 Opat room%%%Dr Pat Meyers%%%University of Melbourne%%%Newtonian noise studies for future generation gravitational-wave detectors%%%Second generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors like Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo have ushered in the era of gravitational wave astronomy and multi-messenger astronomy with several detections of compact binary mergers. One of the next frontiers of GW astrophysics is to detect and to characterize the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). A measurement of an astrophysical SGWB (like that caused by many unresolved compact binary mergers) could happen in the next few years with second generation detectors, but the ability to detect relic GWs, like those produced in many models of the early Universe, with third generation ground-based interferometric detectors will require significant improvements in strain sensitivity at frequencies below ~10 Hz. In this talk, I will broadly discuss the challenges in improving sensitivity at low frequencies before focusing on noise caused by local gravitational perturbations, known as Newtonian noise. Newtonian noise can be caused by density fluctuations in the Earth (seismic waves) and the atmosphere (density and temperature fluctuations) and current estimates suggest that it will likely be a limiting noise source for future GW detectors at low frequencies. I will discuss a 3-dimensional seismometer array at the former Homestake gold mine in Lead, SD, whose primary goal is to estimate and better understand Newtonian noise, and to develop techniques for mitigating it in future GW detectors. Along the way, I'll also introduce some basic seismology, and highlight how some of our results are useful to the broader seismological community.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%pmeyers.jpg%%%-%%%pat.meyers[at]unimelb.edu.au%%%pmeyers.pdf

K-M giant and supergiant stars are surrounded by a hot layer called the chromosphere, which likely powers Magneto-Hydrodynamic Alfven waves that drive their mass loss. Toward the end of their life, on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), stars produce heavy chemical elements, molecules, and dust, which, through the mass loss provided via their stellar winds, are placed into the interstellar medium.\n This talk will explore ongoing work modeling high-resolution spectroscopic observations with Hubble Space Telescope instruments (Rau et al. 2018, subm.), to reveal the role of the chromosphere in driving K-M giant and supergiant winds. Our results include estimates of wind and chromospheric parameters, mass-loss rates, and fundamental stellar parameters.\n In addition, ground-based interferometric measurements with high-angular resolution instruments from VLTI, such as MIDI (Rau et al. 2015, Rau et al. 2017) and GRAVITY (Wittkowski et al. 2018), helped to test geometrical and dynamical models describing the behavior of the outer AGB atmospheres at various spatial scales. In this way we are able to unravel the role of molecules and dust in their extended atmospheres.\n Future plans include the use of high-angular resolution instruments such as VEGA at CHARA, and MATISSE at VLTI, to better understand the behavior of cool stars outer atmospheres at various spatial scales. %%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%grau.jpg%%%-%%%gioia.rau@nasa.gov%%%grau.pdf

20181102%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 6 Opat room%%%Ruby Byrne%%%University of Washington%%%Fundamental Limitations on the Calibration of Redundant 21-cm Cosmology Instruments%%%Precise instrument calibration is critical to the success of 21-cm Cosmology experiments. In recent years, redundant calibration has emerged as a potential solution to calibration errors associated with an incomplete sky model. We show that redundant calibration, like traditional sky-based calibration, is susceptible to errors from sky model incompleteness. These errors contaminate the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) signal and can preclude a measurement.\n Astrophysical foregrounds are 4-5 orders-of-magnitude brighter than the cosmological signal, but because they are spectrally smooth they are in principle separable. Unmitigated calibration errors can couple bright foreground emission to higher power spectrum modes, making an EoR signal detection impossible. Barry et al. 2016 identifies one class of systematic errors that emerge from calibrating to an incomplete sky model (N. Barry et al., Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 461, 2016). Missing sources in the sky model, along with their associated point spread functions, introduce chromatic calibration errors that contaminate the power spectrum modes sensitive to the EoR.\n Barry et al. 2016 explored these errors in the context of sky calibration, but it has been unclear if they also affect the calibration of redundant arrays. We present a mathematical framework to show that redundant calibration is vulnerable to errors from sky model incompleteness that emerge in the "absolute calibration" step, in which degenerate calibration parameters are calculated from a sky model. Using end-to-end power spectrum simulations with idealized radio arrays and sky models, we show that these errors can prevent an EoR detection even in the limit of perfect array redundancy and no thermal noise. Finally, we suggest error mitigation strategies with implications for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%rbyrne.png%%%-%%%rlbyrne@uw.edu%%%rbyrne.pdf

A fraction of these disks, referred to as transition disks, were identified to harbor inner clearings in their dust distribution, with some of these gaps extending over several dozens au, possibly due to dynamical carving by nascent giant planets. \nHere I will first provide a brief description of state-of-the-art high-contrast imaging techniques, and then discuss results obtained from their application to the search of direct signals from protoplanets in transition disks. I will also explain how the characterization of structures seen in transition disks (e.g. gaps, spiral arms) and disk kinematics can be used to provide independent mass constraints on young embedded companions.

Over this time, numerous predictions and tests have strengthened the belief in GR as the foremost theory when discussing gravity.  However, GR cannot in its present form be reconciled with either quantum mechanics, or many cosmological observations such as galactic rotation curves or the accelerated expansion of the universe.  In an attempt to rectify these shortcomings, modified theories of gravity have been proposed.  In this talk, I will present one of these theories and discuss my current work in attempting to test its validity through the development of an exterior spacetime (metric) for a neutron star.  From this, we expect to be able to develop a pulse profile which can be used, in conjunction with observations made of the x-ray flux of radiating neutron stars, to place constraints on the theory.%%%-%%%Graduate Student%%%asaffer.jpeg%%%-%%%alexander.saffer[at]montana.edu%%%asaffer.pdf

With only a few detectors online, the poor directional resolution of the GW antennae network leaves hundreds of square degrees to be searched for associated transients. The large number of false-positives which simultaneously litter the sky represent a major challenge to reliably identify and link potential EM counterparts to GW events. In this talk, I will discuss the Gravitational-Wave Optical Transient Observatory (GOTO) which is dedicated to the follow-up of GW event triggers; as well as the ways in which we automatically detect and classify potential astrophysical transients using unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms on image-subtracted data. I will also discuss exciting research avenues with routine joint GW-EM observations, such as GW-EM parameter estimation, which may provide further constraints on the Hubble constant independent of the cosmological distance-ladder.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Research Fellow%%%kackley.jpg%%%-%%%kendall.ackley[at]monash.edu%%%kackley.pdf

These qualitative morphologies also inform us about the mass of the black hole residing at a spiral galaxy's centre. Specifically, spiral galaxies that typically possess the largest black holes have large bulges and tightly wound spiral arms.

The short timescales associated with the quenching process make it difficult to catch galaxies "in the act" of shutting down their star formation. Compact star-forming galaxies, making-up ~7% of our sample, are selected to have properties aligned with already quenched galaxies at the same or lower redshifts but forming stars at rates 2-10x higher. We measure resolved kinematics of ~30 of these galaxies within the KMOS3D survey. Our results - the first resolved spectral data of such objects - show that compact star-forming galaxies are rotationally-dominated systems, providing strong evidence that recently quenched galaxies at these epochs are likely to be "fast rotators" . The majority of compact star-forming galaxies show evidence of low molecular gas fractions from ALMA observations and nuclear activity indicative of secular quenching processes that may retain the rotation observed in the star-forming phase. The KMOS3D survey, an integral field survey of over 600 galaxies at z=0.7-2.7 using KMOS at the VLT, will make their data public this year. In addition to the above science (Wisnioski et al. 2018) I will describe the survey and data products that will soon be available to the Australian community.%%%-%%%ASTRO 3D Fellow%%%ewisnioski.png%%%-%%%emily.wisnioski[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

Particular attention is given to instabilities arising from conditions unique to neutron stars, such as two-stream instabilities driven by the relative rotation between the proton and neutron condensates in the core.

The observed field is consistent with a global ocean layer with a high dissolved salt content. However, ice layer thickness, ocean depth, and salinity determined from induced magnetic field measurements are dependent on the model applied to represent the interior structure. Past studies attempting to constrain ocean properties have all assumed spherical symmetry, which is not expected for Europa and restricts the validity of the derived constraints. Quantifying the degree of potential asymmetry in the ocean and ice layer is critical to future exploration. Interpretation of magnetic measurements by the upcoming Europa Clipper mission, especially considering plume activity that may have degenerate signals, may be impossible without asymmetric interior models. In this work, we aim to identify constraints on the spatial asymmetry that may be present in Europa's oceans. Constraints will be determined as extremes in low-order spherical harmonics describing the ice-ocean boundary that are consistent with Galileo gravity and magnetometer measurements and realistic ocean parameters, assuming uniform ocean conductivity. Preliminary results and plans for future work will be presented.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%mstyczinski.png%%%-%%%mjstyczi@uw.edu%%%-

20180816%%%14 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Opat room%%%Dr Lucy Forman%%%Curtin University%%% Exploring the effects of crystallographic orientation on shock features in Martian meteorites: how does the orientation of a crystal affect how it bends or breaks?%%% Shock features within Martian samples are thought to result primarily from the impact that launched them from the surface of Mars, and so exploring the material response can help constrain shock parameters, related impact processes and locate candidate launch craters on the Martian surface. Different minerals have varied material responses to stress and, more specifically in this case, the stress applied by a propagating shockwave. Slip systems must be activated in each grain so that the crystal lattice can be deformed. However, often the dominant activated slip system is dependent upon the orientation the stress is applied in, with relation to the crystallographic orientation of the grain, and the physical conditions of the material at the time of impact. Here we explore the effect of crystallographic orientation on the quantifiable amount of crystal deformation that is generated in an impact scenario on the Martian surface. \nThe initial focus of this study is the lherzolitic Shergottite Roberts Massif (RBT) 04262, which comprises poikilitic pyroxenes amongst a pyroxene and olivine-rich mineralogy. We initially examined a large (10 x 7 mm) twinned pyroxene grain. At the macro scale, shock is heterogeneous but no mineral phase changes have been observed, therefore overall shock is limited. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques were used to determine pyroxene orientation to constrain spectral characteristics and understand the style of deformation within the grains. The data comprise crystallographic information from all mineral phases at a step size of 12.2 µm.\n The twinned pyroxene grain is primarily pigeonite based on the composition, and was divided into twins A & B. Twin A shows very little internal deformation in the pigeonite region (<2 º), but a consistently greater amount of misorientation is present in the augite rim. However, twin B, which is twinned on the [001] plane with twin A, shows a variable amount of misorientation throughout the crystal, which appears to undulate in contrast to the radial trend in deformation in twin A.\n This sample has a very low porosity, which would have also been true at the time of impact, and therefore heterogeneities in shock are not due to shockwave interactions arising from interaction with pores. We subsequently infer the crystallographic orientation of each grain dictated the degree of crystal-plastic deformation generated by the shock wave. Further EBSD microstructural analysis will be used to constrain the slip systems that have been activated in the pigeonite, and subsequently constrain the physical conditions at the time of impact. This approach may allow determination of the shockwave propagation direction with respect to the plane of the sample. Further Martian samples have been investigated using this analytical approach. This study will contribute directly to our understanding of impact-induced deformation in a suite of rocks ejected from the Martian surface at the same time, and potentially by the same impact event.%%%-%%%Research Associate%%%lforman.png%%%-%%%lucy.forman[at]curtin.edu.au%%%-

Modelling the physical mechanism that produces these glitches is an endeavour that spans many scales: from the quantum mechanical, microscopic interaction of vortices in the superfluid interior to the macroscopic motion of the rigid stellar crust. We can simulate vortex-avalanche-induced glitches by constructing a Gross-Pitaevskii model from first-principles, thereby incorporating the microscopic physics of superfluid vortices (Warszawski, Melatos, 2011; Melatos, Douglass & Simula, 2015). A complementary approach is to model pulsar glitches as a state-dependent Poisson process, thereby capturing the global behaviour of glitching pulsars (Fulgenzi, Melatos & Hughes, 2017). Bridging the stellar and microscopic scales described in these two approaches is an enormous computational and theoretical challenge. These models can each be extended in various ways, for example by including the interaction with the proton superconductor in the core (Drummond & Melatos, 2017). Competition between vortex-vortex repulsion and vortex-flux-tube attraction (pinning) leads to "glassy" behaviour characterized by multiple metastable states spaced closely in energy. Vortex tangles emerge as a consequence of the frustration in the system. The tangles evolve in a complicated fashion when driven out of equilibrium and a three-dimensional investigation reveals new vortex behaviours for misaligned magnetic and rotation axes.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%ldrummond.jpg%%%-%%%l.drummond[at]student.unimelb.edu.au%%%-

Known pulsars therefore are intriguing targets for searches for such signals. In this talk I will give an overview of searches for gravitational waves from pulsars using the LIGO and Virgo detectors. I will describe some recent work that may provide some evidence that millisecond pulsars have a minimum ellipticity, which makes detection of these sources more plausible with future gravitational detectors.

Observational constraints and numerical simulations increasingly favour the "direct collapse" scenario. In this case, an atomically-cooled halo of primordial composition accretes rapidly onto a single protostellar core, ultimately collapsing through the Chandrasekhar-Feynman instability to produce a supermassive (~100,000 solar mass) "seed" black hole. In this talk, I'll present a systematic study of the lives and deaths of these objects, using the 1D implicit hydrodynamics and stellar evolution code KEPLER. We include post-Newtonian corrections to gravity and a detailed treatment of nuclear burning processes using an adaptive network. We find a simple relation between the infall rate and the final mass at collapse, and rule out the existence of rapidly-rotating supermassive stars. I'll also discuss the possibility of early chemical enrichment from these objects, observational prospects in the era of the JWST, and briefly summarize other future directions agreed upon at our workshop "Titans of the Early Universe" held at the Monash Prato Centre in Italy, in November of last year.%%%-%%%Post-doctoral Research Fellow%%%twoods.jpg%%%-%%%tyrone.woods[at]monash.edu%%%twoods.pdf

However the detection of the redshifted 21cm signal is difficult due to the bright foregrounds. For mitigating the foreground contamination, the cross correlation with other observable is useful. Here, we predict the detectability of the cross power spectrum between 21cm signal and Lyman-alpha emitter (LAE) by using numerical reionization simulation and assuming ongoing and future observations. For 21cm observation, we assume radio survey by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The LAEs are detected at z=5.7, 6.6 and 7.3 by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC).  In this work, we find that the MWA can detect the signal by combining the spectroscopic survey with the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). In practice, however, the error of cross power spectrum is dominated by the foregrounds, and moderate foreground removal is required.%%%-%%%-%%%syoshiura.png%%%-%%%161d9002[at]st.kumamoto-u.ac.jp%%%-

However, when it comes to studying their properties as a function of redshift and/or environment, the most-detailed studies tend to be limited by small-number statistics. In this talk, I will present a new sample of nearly 2,000 of the brightest radio-sources in the southern hemisphere (Dec. < 30 deg). These were observed at low radio-frequencies as part of the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, conducted using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

Thanks to the location of the MWA in a protected, radio-quiet zone, we have excellent spectral coverage for these sources, with 20 radio flux-densities spanning a frequency range of 72-231 MHz. A key component of this project is identifying the appropriate host galaxy of the radio emission, with these positions feeding into target lists for the Taipan Galaxy Survey. Having 10 times as many sources as the most-prominent, low-frequency radio-source sample that is optically complete (the revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources; 3CRR), the GLEAM 4-Jy Sample will allow models of powerful active galactic nuclei to be tested more robustly.%%%-%%%Research Associate%%%swhite.jpg%%%-%%%Sarah.White1[at]curtin.edu.au%%%swhite.pdf

Black hole spin has so far been inferred largely from electromagnetic observations of surrounding matter. Gravitational-wave observations of coalescences can probe the spin and precession of the black holes themselves. Using a Bayesian parameter estimatin pipeline, we characterize a method for detecting evidence of precession. Precession might conceivably be seen in either high-signal-to-noise ratio events with favorably parameters, or in a statistical ensemble of many events. We use simulated events with numerical-relativity approximant waveforms to estimate the detectability of precession.%%%-%%%Research Fellow%%%gmeadors.jpeg%%%-%%%grant.meadors[at]monash.edu%%%gmeadors.pdf

We enhance EoR upper limits from the Murchison Widefield Array through the improvement of instrumental calibration with in situ simulations, and the reduced limit highlights the precision and accuracy that we must achieve. An in situ calibration simulation verifies our experimental findings, and identifies the fundamental limits of sky-based calibration.

We investigate the balance between the heating by stellar radiation, and neutral gas cooling dominated by [CII] emission line. [CII] is typically the brightest far-IR emission line from star-forming galaxies, and it has been proven to be a useful SFR tracer, both locally and at high redshifts, however, with some vital caveats. Specifically, we are interested wheather there are any changes in the efficiency of the photoelectric heating (PEeff), the dominant heating mechanism of the neutral gas, that might affect reliability of the [CII] as a SFR tracer.  To address these issues, we have assembled a unique set of observations in two nearby galaxies, M31 and M51. Multi wavelength FUV-FIR photometric coverage enables a well constrained SED modelling. Key observations of [CII] emission at high, 50pc, resolution in five SF regions in M31 (Herschel), and the first fully mapped galaxy at ~650pc resolution in M51 (SOFIA), enable a local and a global studies.  Finally, we model individually resolved stars with 6 band HST photometry down to spectral type F0 with PHAT survey in M31 using BEAST (Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool) for an independent measurement of the heating at smallest scales. A commonly used ratio [CII]/TIR (total IR emission), fails as a proxy for PEeff, because the TIR measures all dust heating, not just the FUV photons capable of ejecting electrons from dust grains (Kapala et al. 2017). We find [CII]/TIR to be strongly correlated with UVatt/TOTatt (inferred from MAGPHYS SED fitting), indicating that, in M31 at least, one of the dominant drivers for [CII]/TIR variation is the relative hardness of the absorbed stellar radiation field. We define PEeff(UV), [CII]/UVatt which should be more closely related to the true PE efficiency, which we find to be essentially constant (1.85 &plusmn 0.8%) in all explored 700x700pc fields in M31, regardless of the value of [CII]/TIR (varying by a factor of 3). I will present the above findings and the preliminary results of the [CII] - SFR relation, and the PEeff(UV) on 650pc scales in M51. I will also explore environmental dependencies on those relations.%%%-%%%SARChI Postdoctoral Fellow%%%mkapala.jpg%%%-%%%kapala[at]ast.uct.ac.za%%%-

Clusters grow through mergers with other clusters, events which give rise to the largest cosmic shock waves. Shocks travel like giant tsunamis through the electron plasma and shape the evolution of the intra-cluster medium. Giant radio relics trace these shock fronts and are thought to form when accelerated electrons emit synchrotron radiation in the presence of a magnetic field. I will present results from the widest frequency study of radio relics, where we combine, for the first time, data covering more than 2 order of magnitude in radio frequency. Our very low and very high radio frequency data challenge the simple, widely accepted model for relic formation. Using unique observations spanning the 150 MHz to 30 GHz range, I will derive physical parameters, such as Mach numbers and electron ages, as well as constrain injection mechanisms. I will also discuss how new models involving re-acceleration of aged seed electrons or evolving magnetic fields can alleviate the discrepancies between observations of relics and theory.%%%-%%%ESO Fellow%%%astroe.jpeg%%%-%%%astroe[at]eso.org%%%astroe.pdf

Gravitational wave detectors are also sensitive to transient noise sources created by the environment and the detector, known as `glitches'. As the rate of astrophysical sources increases, the probability that a signal will occur at the same time as a glitch also increases. This has occurred previously in the gravitational wave binary neutron star merger detection GW170817. In this talk, we examine the effect of glitches on the measurement of signal parameters and Bayesian model selection. We include binary black holes similar to current detections, sine Gaussian bursts, and core-collapse supernovae. We examine if the effects of glitches are worse when there is a mis-match between the signal model and the data.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%jpowell.jpg%%%-%%%jpowell[at]swin.edu.au%%%jpowell.pdf

By de-redshifting and scaling photometry of many tens to hundreds of galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions, we can create low resolution spectra (R~50), quantifying features such as emission line equivalent widths with more precision than possible for a single galaxy without spectroscopy. In this talk I will detail the use of this method with ~7000 high signal to noise galaxies from the ZFOURGE survey. This allows us to identify and characterize populations of galaxies in the green valley, which show morphologies, dust content, and star formation rates between those of star-forming and quenched populations.

There is mounting evidence that these bright, dispersed pulses of radio emission originate at cosmological (gigaparsec) distances.  Not only do the energetics of the events point to a new radiative process, but the pulses are imprinted with propagation through the ionised intergalactic medium and cosmic web, making them invaluable probes of media invisible to most other types of observations.   Despite considerable effort to detect additional bursts, the yields have been low because of relatively narrow fields of view of most searches.  Here I will present the discovery of 20 FRBs from a wide-area survey conducted with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP),  nearly doubling the total number of known FRBs in only one year of surveying.  The burst properties suggest a cosmologically evolving population with a wide luminosity function.    I will then discuss future plans to develop interferometric fast transient capabilities with ASKAP, necessary to harness the full value of FRBs.    To conclude, I will present the very recent discovery of two FRBs with the  Parkes telescope, one of which is the highest signal-to-noise ratio burst seen to date.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%rshannon.JPG%%%-%%%Ryan.Shannon[at]csiro.au%%%rshannon.pdf

Globular cluster formation tells us about the conditions of extreme star formation while their survival from high redshift tell us about the processes of galaxy assembly. Being much brighter than red giant stars, globular clusters allow the stellar populations of galaxies to be studied at much greater distances. Thus a wider range of galaxy masses, environments and morphologies to be studied than can be with resolved stars. Using data from the WAGGS survey of massive star clusters in the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies and the SLUGGS survey of the globular cluster systems of massive early-type galaixes, I will talk about how we can measure the metallicities of globular clusters using the strength of the calcium triplet in integrated light. Using globular cluster metallicity distributions and the relationships between globular cluster colour and metallicity, I will present evidence that different galaxies with similar masses experienced different formation histories. I will compare these observations with the predictions of the E-MOSAICS cosmological simulations of the formation of globular cluster systems.

The Advanced LIGO detectors were joined by the Advanced Virgo detector in the recently concluded second observing run (O2). Another two binary black hole mergers, GW170104 and GW170814, have been announced so far from this analysis, with the analysis of the data ongoing. These observations confirmed the existence of merging stellar mass black hole binaries originating in low metallicity environments. How to form merging binary black holes remains an open question theoretically. There are many proposed mechanisms, falling broadly into two families: 1) Isolated binary evolution and 2) dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. We show that comparing the distribution of observed black hole masses and spins to those predicted from population models will allow us to gain insight into how binary black holes form. We examine the measurements of the effective spin parameters for the 5 binary black hole observations published thus far and show that the data already exhibit a mild (2.7 sigma) preference for an isotropic distribution of spins over spins aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes in these systems could be intrinsically small (average spin magnitude < 0.2), at odds with measurements of black hole spin magnitudes in high mass X-ray binaries. Both of these conclusions have implications for the formation of binary black holes, and the formation of heavy black holes in supernovae.%%%-%%%OzGrav postdoctoral fellow%%%sstevenson.jpg%%%-%%%spstevenson[at]swin.edu.au%%%sstevenson.pdf

Stranger still, another NYT writer later reported that the film rights had been taken up, and that Tom Hanks had been invited to play Sandage. No movie was made, however, and the controversy was cleared up a few years later by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The age of the expanding universe is now known to an accuracy of a few percent.</p><p>There is now a new urgency for increased accuracy in measurements of the Hubble Constant, the misnomer for the current epoch value of the accelerating expansion rate. Stellar Populations and the Distance Scale, sometimes called the distance ladder, as it ascends from the geometric diameter of the Earth's orbit, has been joined by a rival ladder, descending from the surface of last scattering of the cosmic background radiation. They were expected to meet in the middle, but there seems to be a gap. Or is there? If there is, the standard model of cosmology, the Nobel prize winning &Lambda;CDM model, may be lacking something important. Is it another neutrino, curvature, or a dark matter-neutrino interaction? Right now, the jury is out, and the race for better data is on. Volume simulations indicate that sample variance is not an issue. Are supernovae really standard candles? The OzDES survey is adDressing this issue.</p><p>The Hubble Constant from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is a standard ruler, rather than a standard candle like supernovae. The ruler is simply the sound horizon at recombination. Simulations tell us that the linear regime for the evolution of structure pertains, and the ruler is unchanged in length in comoving coordinates to a fraction of a percent over the life of the Universe. The Taipan project is expected to achieve 1% accuracy in H0 (1&sigma;) from redshifts of over a million galaxies in the next 5 years.

For this purpose, we set up the physical conditions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the redshift of the EoR, and we post-process the simulations to implement a uniform UV ionizing background for quasars and galaxies (Haardt-Madau 2012), the metal ions with CLOUDY 8.1 and HI self-shielding prescription (Rahmati et al. 2013). We use Voigt profile fitting to compute the column densities of the ions from the synthetic spectra and obtain a statistical distribution of the absorbers. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the state of the IGM at high redshift, compute the cosmological mass density of CIV and HI and other ions.  Our simulations produce absorbers properties that are in good agreement with observations in the literature, especially for the high ionization species.<p>Furthermore, we are able to reproduce an observed example of an LAE galaxy-CIV absorber pair at z=5.7, proving a physical insight into such systems beyond the limit of current observations. Finally, we vary of the uniform UVB at z~6, and compare directly with observations of different metal ions, in order to constrain the ionizing background at the tail of Reionization.%%%-%%%PhD student%%%langela.jpg%%%-%%%lgarcia[at]swin.edu.au%%%agarcia.pdf

Our new method tracks the physical properties of radio jets in massive galaxies, including the evolution of radio lobes and their impact on the surrounding gas. Unlike the previous efforts of Croton et al. 2006, we now self consistently track the cooling-heating cycle that significantly shapes the life and death of many types of galaxies. Adding jet physics to SAGE adds new physical properties to the model output, which in turn allows us to make more detailed predictions for the AGN and galaxy populations, and build customised AGN-focused mock survey catalogues for comparison with observations.%%%-%%%Professor%%%dcroton.jpg%%%-%%%dcroton[at]astro.swin.edu.au%%%dcroton.pdf

Together the HST WFC3/IR and ACS cameras have opened up the exploration of the universe in the first billion years after the Big Bang.  I will discuss what we have learned about the earliest galaxies during the reionization epoch at z>6 from the remarkable HST and Spitzer imaging surveys (e.g., HUDF/XDF, GOODS, HUDF09/12 and CANDELS), as well as surveys of galaxy clusters like the Frontier Fields (HFF). Lensing clusters provide extraordinary opportunities for characterizing the faintest earliest galaxies, but also present extraordinary challenges. Together these surveys have reliably established the volume density of galaxies in the first billion years down to extremely faint levels around -14.5 mag. The results from deep UV luminosity functions from Hubble, combined with the recent results from Planck, indicate that galaxies dominate the UV ionizing flux that reionized the universe. Some of the greatest surprises have come from the discovery of very luminous galaxies at z~8-11, around 400-650 million years after the Big Bang. Spectroscopic followup of these very rare, bright galaxies has confirmed redshifts from z~7 to z~11, and revealed, surprisingly, strong Ly&alpha; emission near the peak of reionization when the HI fraction in the IGM is high. The small sizes of galaxies at high redshifts, from analysis of the HFF cluster samples, reveal objects that, remarkably, are as small as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. The recent confirmation of a z=11.1 galaxy, just 400 million years after the Big Bang, by a combination of Hubble and Spitzer data, pushed Hubble into JWST territory, far beyond what we ever expected Hubble could do.  Twenty years of astonishing progress with Hubble and Spitzer leave me looking to JWST to provide even more remarkable exploration of the realm of the first galaxies at "Cosmic Sunrise".  The latest results on the sizes of distant galaxies, on the star formation rate density at z~10 and from Planck indicating that reionization began around z~10 together have significant implications for the detectability of the "first galaxies" with JWST.%%%-%%%Professor%%%gillingworth.jpg%%%-%%%gedi[at]ucolick.org%%%gillingworth.pdf

When, why and how galaxies become passive is a crucial question in modern astrophysics, and might be related to both the galaxy intrinsic properties, and to the environment in which galaxies live. In particular, the cluster/denser environments are particularly efficient in quenching the star formation and therefore represent an ideal place where investigating galaxy properties. I will present the results that we obtained by studying a large sample of low-redshift clusters for which we have been able to characterize the different populations of galaxies on their way to become passive. I will also report on the Eso GASP Large Program, that is devoted to the study of a sample of cluster and field galaxies that show signatures of gas stripping at various degrees. GASP makes use of the MUSE IFU spectrograph at VLT, and has already observed ~50% of its targets.

The Bayesian approach  involves treating models and parameters similarly to data, as unknown variables with their own underlying probability distributions. However, as data from cosmological observables increases in constraining power, the opportunity arises for tensions between the different data sets, where the statistical limits on derived on certain parameters appears not to be coincident. This tensions can be generated either by an insufficient model, and so indicates the presence of new physics, by undiagnosed systematic errors, or simply by random statistical chance. In my talk I discuss different methods for diagnosing tensions, and show how these have been applied to the observed parameter tension between the cosmic microwave background data and measurements of the weak lensing shear power spectrum.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow, Senior Lecturer%%%dparkinson.jpg%%%-%%%d.parkinson[at]uq.edu.au%%%dparkinson.pdf

Despite major developments in the 1960s and decades of studies, we still don't know what the necessary and sufficient conditions are for spiral arm formation.  Current efforts on the theory of spiral arm formation primarily focus on testing variations of density wave or swing amplifications on nearby galaxies.  Progress in this field is slow.  Breakthroughs can come from observations of high-redshift galaxies when spiral arms are in the early stage of formation.  In this talk, I will present my first results on integral field spectroscopic observations of the most ancient spiral galaxies at z>2, including gravitationally lensed galaxies.  The high-spatial resolution kinematic fields imply a population of rare spiral galaxies living in dynamically cold environments at high redshift.  I will discuss how ongoing follow-up IFS observations on a larger sample of spiral galaxies at z>2 can help to constrain the earliest onset mechanisms for spiral arms.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%yuantt.jpg%%%sprialarm.jpg%%%tiantian.yuan[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

I use the intrinsic colours and measured the fraction of kinetic energy invested in ordered rotation of 3562 galaxies at z=0 with stellar masses larger than 10^10 solar masses. I find that EAGLE produces a galaxy population whose morphology correlates with the colour bimodality for central and satellite galaxies alike. The red-sequence is mostly populated elliptical-type galaxies and most of blue-cloud galaxies are disc-type. I analyse gri-composite images of orderly rotating galaxies and show that many resolve a disc structure and spiral arms. These results show that the connection between mass, intrinsic colour and morphology arise naturally from galaxy formation models able to reproduce observed star formation relations and galaxy abundance distributions. In this talk I will discuss these findings, and use galaxy morphology (that holds clue to past merger history) and the galaxy distribution on the color-mass diagram to disentangle different evolutionary paths.

Signatures of the baryon cycle such as IGM accretion, minor mergers, and stellar-Driven outflows and fountains are best probed in gaseous halos, i.e., the circumgalactic medium (CGM). I use Keck, VLT, and HST spectra of background quasars to examine the geometric and kinematic properties of the multiphase, metal-enriched CGM of galaxies at 0.08&lt;z&lt;1.0, focusing on the low-ionization MgII and high-ionization OVI absorption doublets. By examining the velocity dispersions of absorbers in the context of the host galaxy color and orientation, I find that the low-ionization gas strongly traces expected baryon cycle processes. In contrast, high-ionization gas tends towards broader kinematics independent of galaxy color and orientation. These results suggest that the low- and high-ionization phases may trace different components of the CGM and provide observational constraints on simulations to accurately model the role that the baryon cycle plays in galaxy evolution.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%nnielsen.jpg%%%cgm.jpg%%%nikolenielsen[at]swin.edu.au%%%nnielsen.pdf

The relationship is investigated in two ways: globally and with individual galaxy-absorber pairs. We find that the Drop in the cosmic mass density of triply ionized Carbon, Omega(CIV), to redshift 5.5 cannot solely be explained by a decrease in the mean metallicty of the Universe over a short period of time. An additional change in the ionizing Background is required, in line with findings of increased neutrality of hyDrogen at the same redshift. Our analysis of galaxy-absorber pairs finds that low luminosity galaxies close to the quasar line of sight are the most likely source of metal absorbers at these redshifts.%%%Special Date%%%Associate Professor%%%eweber.jpg%%%Reionization-timeline.jpg%%%eryanweber[at]swin.edu.au%%%eweber.pdf

I will summarize old theoretical results about accretion onto haloes, and present some recent work of gas accretion onto filaments. Once cold flows penetrate through hot virialized haloes, supersonic Kelvin Helmholtz instability occurs, with specific patterns of unstable KH modes.
